Understanding  how commonly genes move between eukaryotic species and whether these transfers confer benefits would be really interesting to find out\n\n# Deep Research Report: Horizontal Gene Transfer in Eukaryotes\n\n**An Analysis of Mechanisms, Impact, and Evolutionary Significance in Plants and Animals**\n\n---\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nHorizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), the movement of genetic material between organisms other than by traditional parent-to-offspring inheritance, has long been recognized as a primary driver of evolution in prokaryotes. However, it was historically considered a rare or non-existent phenomenon in complex multicellular eukaryotes like plants and animals. This report synthesizes current research demonstrating that HGT in non-microbial systems, while less frequent than in bacteria, is a significant and potent source of evolutionary innovation.\n\nKey findings indicate that genes are transferred between eukaryotic species through various vectors, including viruses, transposable elements, parasites, and physical phenomena like grafting. Documented cases reveal that these transfers can confer substantial adaptive advantages, such as disease resistance in wheat (from fungi), carotenoid synthesis in aphids (from fungi), and freeze tolerance in fish (from other fish).\n\nThe detection of HGT is a complex bioinformatic challenge, requiring researchers to rigorously distinguish true transfer events from confounding factors like contamination, differential gene loss, and phylogenetic artifacts. Despite these hurdles, a growing body of evidence is shifting the scientific consensus. The debate is moving from *if* HGT occurs in eukaryotes to *how much* it occurs and its overall impact. Research now suggests HGT is a key mechanism for rapid adaptation, providing novel functions that can take millions of years to fully integrate into the host's regulatory networks, ultimately reshaping our understanding of the Tree of Life.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Foundational Concepts: HGT in Eukaryotes vs. Prokaryotes\n\nHorizontal Gene Transfer is a well-established and frequent evolutionary mechanism in prokaryotes, where it is a primary driver of adaptation, such as the spread of antibiotic resistance. In contrast, HGT has historically been considered far less common in eukaryotes, particularly in animals [https://www.the-scientist.com/horizontal-gene-transfer-happens-more-often-than-anyone-thought-70118]. Until the early 2000s, the transfer of DNA between complex eukaryotic genomes was thought to be improbable, if not impossible. This perspective was supported by limited available evidence and the understanding that gene transfer between multicellular organisms would be inherently more difficult than in microbial systems [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2148, https://texasgateway.org/resource/203-perspectives-on-the-phylogenetic-tree].\n\nThe concept of HGT in eukaryotes also challenges traditional evolutionary models, which depict evolution as a branching tree of life based on vertical inheritance. HGT introduces web-like connections that can blur species boundaries and complicate the reconstruction of evolutionary histories [https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nyas.14471]. However, with increasing genomic data, HGT events in eukaryotes are being reported with greater frequency, though the precise mechanisms often remain obscure.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Mechanisms and Vectors of HGT in Non-Microbial Systems\n\nWhile the exact pathways are not always fully understood, research has identified several key biological and physical vectors that facilitate HGT in plants and animals.\n\n*   **Viruses and Transposable Elements:** Viral infections can serve as a conduit for HGT. In multicellular eukaryotes, the most documented instances of HGT involve the movement of transposable elements (transposons), with over 200 cases recorded. The introduction of these mobile genetic elements is now considered a major force for genomic variation and biological innovation in eukaryotes.\n*   **Parasites and Endosymbionts:** Intracellular organisms are potent agents of HGT. The parasitic bacterium *Wolbachia* is a notable example, considered an ideal donor because it is inherited maternally through the host's egg cytoplasm. Gene sequences from *Wolbachia* have been found integrated into the genomes of their arthropod hosts, demonstrating that these transfers have likely occurred many times and contributed to host genome evolution [https://www.cell.com/molecular-plant/fulltext/S1674-2052(22)00049-1].\n*   **Grafting and Hybridization:** In plants, HGT can occur via grafting, where tissues from two distinct plants fuse. This process allows for the movement of genomic DNA between species that may be sexually incompatible [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1114076109]. This transfer can be remarkably extensive, with evidence showing that all three of a plant's genomes (nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast) can move across the graft junction. In some cases, entire nuclear genomes are transferred [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abd8215]. A well-documented example is \"chloroplast capture,\" where the chloroplast genome from one plant species is transferred to another, such as from cultivated tobacco to tree tobacco [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1114076109].\n*   **Phagocytosis:** One proposed model for HGT involves phagocytosis, where a host organism (like a protist) consumes another organism as food. During digestion, some of the foreign DNA from the consumed organism can survive and become incorporated into the host's genome [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002%2Fbies.201300007, https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1533212100]. For multicellular eukaryotes, it is suggested that unicellular and early developmental stages are the most likely points of entry for this foreign material [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4033532/].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Documented Cases and Functional Impact\n\nSpecific, well-validated cases of HGT in plants and animals underscore the significant adaptive advantages these transfers can provide.\n\n#### 3.1 HGT in Plants\n\nIn the plant kingdom, HGT has been shown to confer novel traits related to stress resistance, metabolic functions, and defense.\n*   **Disease Resistance:** The *Fhb7* gene, transferred from fungi, provides strong resistance to Fusarium Head Blight (FHB), a devastating crop disease. This discovery has been leveraged to develop FHB-resistant wheat varieties [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pei3.70087].\n*   **Pathogen Defense:** The plant's basic secretory protein (*BSP*) gene family, crucial for pathogen resistance and other stress responses, was acquired from bacteria early in the evolution of land plants [https://www.cell.com/molecular-plant/fulltext/S1674-2052(22)00049-1].\n*   **Plant-to-Plant Transfers:** A gene was documented to have been transferred from the parasitic plant *Striga* to its host, sorghum [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12448838/]. Furthermore, there is widespread evidence of mitochondrial genes being horizontally transferred among diverse species of flowering plants [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401529/].\n\n#### 3.2 HGT in Animals\n\nWhile historically thought to be rare in metazoans, functional HGT events have been confirmed in diverse animal groups including nematodes, arthropods, and vertebrates.\n*   **Metabolic Innovation:** Aphids acquired the ability to synthesize their own carotenoids\u2014a vital metabolic capability\u2014by obtaining the necessary genes from fungi, likely through consumption.\n*   **Adaptation to Extreme Environments:** In a landmark case of vertebrate-to-vertebrate HGT, the rainbow smelt acquired an antifreeze protein gene from the herring approximately 20 million years ago. This transfer allows the smelt to survive in icy waters. Further analysis suggests the herring may have originally acquired this gene via HGT itself.\n*   **Broad Adaptive Functions:** Across eukaryotes, HGT has provided genes for a range of functions, including the degradation of plant carbohydrates, biosynthesis of cofactors and vitamins, metabolism of amino acids, and protection from other organisms [http://mccutcheonlab.org/s/17_husnik_nrm.pdf].\n\n---\n\n### 4. Methodologies and Challenges in HGT Detection\n\nIdentifying true HGT events in eukaryotic genomes is a significant bioinformatic challenge, requiring stringent criteria to rule out alternative explanations.\n\n#### 4.1 Detection Methods\n\nResearchers employ several computational techniques to identify putative HGT events:\n*   **Phylogenetic Analysis:** This is considered a reliable statistical method for confirming HGT. It involves constructing an evolutionary tree for a specific gene and comparing it to the accepted evolutionary tree of the species involved. A strong incongruence between the gene tree and the species tree is a hallmark of HGT [\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.05.686818v1.full.pdf\"].\n*   **Codon Usage Bias:** This method analyzes the frequency of different codons (three-nucleotide DNA sequences) used to encode amino acids. A gene transferred from a distant organism may retain the codon usage pattern of its donor, making it stand out from the host's native genes. However, this method is known to generate a high number of false positives and negatives [\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4462595/\", \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11811736/\"].\n\n#### 4.2 Key Challenges\n\nConfirming HGT requires distinguishing it from several confounding factors:\n*   **Contamination:** This is the most common problem, where DNA from bacteria, fungi, parasites, or lab reagents is accidentally sequenced along with the host genome. Many early reports of HGT in eukaryotes, including in the human genome draft, were later retracted as contamination events [1, 3, 7].\n*   **Differential Gene Loss:** A gene may have been present in a common ancestor and subsequently lost in several descendant lineages. The remaining lineages that retain the gene can create a \"patchy\" distribution that mimics HGT [1, 2, 3, 7].\n*   **Phylogenetic Artifacts and Convergent Evolution:** Errors in the models used to build evolutionary trees or the independent evolution of similar gene sequences in unrelated lineages can both create false signals of HGT [1, 2, 3, 4, 6].\n\n---\n\n### 5. Evolutionary Significance and Future Outlook\n\n#### 5.1 A Driver of Innovation, Not a Mere Curiosity\n\nThe scientific consensus is shifting to view HGT as a major driver of innovation in eukaryotic evolution. Rather than a collection of rare exceptions, HGT is a mechanism that provides \"unprecedented adaptive potential\" by introducing entirely new functions into a genome. It allows for the rapid acquisition of beneficial traits, contributing to the formation of \"larger, fitter genomes than could be achieved by purely vertical inheritance.\"\n\n#### 5.2 Quantifying Prevalence\n\nThe central question in the field is no longer *if* HGT occurs in eukaryotes, but *how much* it occurs [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-023-00688-5]. The increasing availability of high-quality genome data is enabling large-scale systematic studies to quantify HGT events across different taxonomic groups. For example, one study identified 745 HGT regions in 10 model organisms, with over 90% of sequenced eukaryotes showing some involvement [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501571v3.full-text]. However, data on whether specific lineages act as \"HGT hotspots\" was unavailable in the provided research, with such hotspots currently identified only in bacteria.\n\n#### 5.3 Gaps and Future Research\n\nKey areas of ongoing and future research include:\n*   **Long-Term Integration:** The integration of a horizontally transferred gene into a host's complex regulatory network is a long-term process, estimated to span 8 to 22 million years. Understanding how these foreign genes become essential components of stable networks is a critical area of study [https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/25/3/559/1060663].\n*   **Improved Detection:** A primary focus for the future is the development of more accurate HGT detection methods. This has spurred a recent surge in new computational and AI-based approaches designed to better identify true transfer events from genomic data [https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/7/1/lqaf005/8008560].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe study of Horizontal Gene Transfer in plants and animals has fundamentally altered our understanding of eukaryotic evolution. Once dismissed as a microbial-centric phenomenon, HGT is now recognized as a potent, albeit relatively infrequent, source of genetic novelty and rapid adaptation in complex multicellular life. From conferring disease resistance in crops to enabling survival in extreme environments, the functional impact of these transfers is undeniable. While significant challenges remain in accurately detecting and quantifying HGT events, ongoing advancements in genomics and bioinformatics are poised to reveal the full extent to which the Tree of Life is interconnected by this fascinating evolutionary mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n*   [1]

        "article": "# In ecology, how do birds achieve precise location and direction navigation during migration? What cues and disturbances influence this process?\n\n# Deep Research Report: Mechanisms of Avian Navigation\n\n**Report ID:** 8023-B\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Status:** Final\n**Commissioned For:** User Inquiry\n**Lead Editor:** Autonomous AI Research Service\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nAvian navigation is a complex, multi-sensory process that enables birds to migrate thousands of kilometers with remarkable precision. This report synthesizes research on the mechanisms governing this ability, framed by Gustav Kramer's foundational \"map-and-compass\" model. This model posits a two-step process: first, the bird determines its location and the direction toward its goal (the \"map\" sense), and second, it uses a directional \"compass\" to maintain the correct heading.\n\nBirds do not rely on a single sense but integrate information from multiple environmental cues. For direction-finding, they employ a time-compensated sun compass, a star compass calibrated to celestial rotation, and a sophisticated magnetic compass. The magnetic sense is particularly complex, likely involving two distinct biophysical mechanisms: a light-dependent quantum process in the eyes for inclination and a magnetite-based system in the beak for intensity. To determine their geographical position (the \"map\"), birds utilize subtle variations in the Earth's magnetic field and large-scale atmospheric odor gradients.\n\nNavigation is not purely instinctual. While first-time migrants rely on an innate, genetically coded \"endogenous time-and-direction programme\" (vector navigation), they develop a more flexible \"true navigation\" system through experience and social learning. This integrated system is vulnerable to both natural disturbances, such as geomagnetic storms, and a growing number of anthropogenic factors, including artificial light, electromagnetic noise, and climate change, which disrupt cues and alter migratory patterns. Current research continues to explore the precise neurobiological pathways and quantum effects that underpin these extraordinary abilities.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### 1. The Map-and-Compass Framework\n\nThe central conceptual model for understanding avian navigation is the \"map-and-compass\" theory, first proposed by Gustav Kramer [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AnBeh..65..257W/abstract]. This framework defines navigation as a two-stage process:\n\n*   **The Map Stage (Positional Awareness):** The bird first determines its current geographic position relative to its destination.\n*   **The Compass Stage (Directional Orientation):** The bird then uses a compass sense to select and maintain the correct bearing or heading to travel towards that destination.\n\nBirds utilize a suite of sensory systems to fulfill these two functions, creating a robust and redundant navigational toolkit.\n\n### 2. The Avian Compass: A Multi-Sensory Toolkit for Direction\n\nBirds possess at least three distinct compass systems that they use depending on the time of day and environmental conditions.\n\n*   **The Time-Compensated Sun Compass:** Diurnal (day-migrating) birds use the sun's position as a primary directional cue. To account for the sun's movement across the sky, birds possess an internal circadian clock that allows them to make the necessary temporal adjustments to maintain a constant heading [https://www.nature.com/articles/news000224-4, https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/the-basics-migration-navigation/]. The sun's daily cycle also serves to keep this internal clock accurately calibrated [https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/migration/content-section-5.2].\n\n*   **The Star Compass:** Nocturnal migrants orient themselves using celestial patterns. Seminal experiments by Stephen T. Emlen, using a device known as an \"Emlen funnel\" inside a planetarium, demonstrated that birds do not rely on individual stars but rather on the rotational center of the night sky [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5513225/, https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/pds/ceqa/Soitec-Documents/Final-EIR-Files/references/rtcref/ch9.0/rtcrefaletters/F1%202014-12-19_Emlen1975.pdf]. This allows them to identify a fixed direction (e.g., North) as the constellations appear to rotate around it. Research indicates that birds learn this celestial map by observing the sky's rotation during their development.\n\n*   **The Magnetic Compass:** Birds can directly perceive the Earth's magnetic field, a sense known as magnetoreception. This compass is functional even in complete darkness or under heavy cloud cover. Research points to two co-existing mechanisms that provide different types of magnetic information.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of Magnetoreception\n\nThe ability to sense the magnetic field is one of the most intensively studied aspects of avian navigation and is believed to operate through two distinct physiological pathways.\n\n*   **The Radical-Pair Mechanism (Inclination Compass):** This light-dependent theory is the leading model for the magnetic *compass* sense. It posits that a quantum process occurs within cryptochrome proteins in the bird's retina [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959438812000074]. When a cryptochrome molecule absorbs a photon of blue light, it creates a pair of molecules with correlated electron spins (a \"radical pair\"). The Earth's magnetic field influences how long these electrons remain in this state, which in turn affects the molecule's chemical products. This process is sensitive to the angle of the magnetic field lines relative to the bird, but not their polarity, effectively creating an \"inclination compass\" that allows the bird to distinguish between \"poleward\" and \"equatorward\" rather than North and South. This visual information is processed in a specialized forebrain region known as Cluster N [https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsif/article/16/158/20190295/87177/Magnetoreception-in-birdsMagnetoreception-in-birds].\n\n*   **The Magnetite-Based Mechanism (Intensity Sensor):** A second theory proposes that microscopic particles of an iron-based mineral called magnetite, located in the upper beak, act as magnetic sensors [https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsif/article/16/158/20190295/87177/Magnetoreception-in-birdsMagnetoreception-in-birds]. These receptors are innervated by the trigeminal nerve and are thought to be sensitive to variations in the *intensity* of the magnetic field. This system may contribute to the \"map\" sense by providing locational information, rather than purely directional information.\n\n### 4. The Avian Map: Establishing a Sense of Place\n\nWhile the compass provides direction, the map tells the bird where it is. Evidence suggests birds construct this map using at least two major environmental gradients.\n\n*   **The Geomagnetic Map:** The Earth's magnetic field varies predictably across its surface. Key properties like inclination angle (steepness of the field lines) and total intensity change with latitude, while other subtle variations could potentially provide longitudinal cues. By sensing these parameters, birds may be able to form a \"grid map\" to determine their geographic position. While theoretically powerful, direct empirical evidence for this grid-map mechanism is still being gathered.\n\n*   **The Olfactory Map:** The olfactory navigation hypothesis suggests that birds, particularly homing pigeons, learn to associate specific atmospheric odors with the wind directions that carry them. During its youth in a home loft, a bird builds an \"olfactory map\" of its surroundings. When displaced to an unfamiliar location, it can identify the local combination of trace gases and use its learned associations to determine the direction home. This sense is considered particularly crucial for homing over shorter distances and navigating over the ocean.\n\n### 5. Genetic Programming vs. Learned Experience\n\nAvian migration is a product of both innate ability and acquired knowledge.\n\n*   **Vector Navigation (Innate):** First-time migrants rely on a genetically coded \"endogenous time-and-direction programme\" [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1838512/]. This internal system dictates the direction and duration of flight without providing the bird with a true sense of its position relative to the goal. It is a \"clock-and-compass\" mechanism that gets the bird started, but it cannot correct for significant displacement.\n\n*   **True Navigation (Learned):** With experience, birds develop a flexible map-and-compass system. This \"true navigation\" allows them to determine their position and re-orient toward a goal even if blown off course. This learned navigational map is built from environmental cues gathered on previous migrations.\n\n*   **Social Learning:** In many long-lived, social species like cranes and geese, juveniles learn migratory routes, stopover sites, and wintering grounds by following experienced adults. This social transmission of knowledge refines and optimizes the innate program, significantly improving survival.\n\n### 6. System Integration and Cue Hierarchy\n\nBirds do not use their compasses in isolation; they are part of an integrated and calibrated system. Cue-conflict experiments, where sensory inputs are artificially manipulated, are used to determine the hierarchy of these cues [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16354773/].\n\n*   **Calibration:** Evidence suggests that the magnetic compass often serves as the primary reference system. Birds appear to calibrate their star and sun compasses against the magnetic field [http://www.j-avianres.com/cn/article/pdf/preview/10.5122/cbirds.2012.0001.pdf]. For example, as a bird migrates across latitudes, the appearance of the night sky changes. The bird can use its unchanging magnetic compass to recalibrate its interpretation of the star patterns [https://www.encyclopedie-environnement.org/en/life/orientation-migratory-birds/].\n\n### 7. Navigational Disturbances\n\nBoth natural phenomena and human activity can interfere with the cues birds rely on for navigation.\n\n*   **Natural Disturbances:** Severe space weather, such as solar flares that cause geomagnetic storms, can disrupt the Earth's magnetic field, making it an unreliable cue [https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10480357]. During these events, the intensity of nocturnal migration has been observed to decrease by 9-17%, as birds may become disoriented or choose to wait for conditions to stabilize [https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/2023/10/10/space-weather-disrupts-nocturnal-bird-migration-study-finds/]. Heavy cloud cover can also obscure celestial cues, forcing birds to rely more heavily on their magnetic sense.\n\n*   **Anthropogenic Disturbances:**\n    *   **Artificial Light at Night (ALAN):** Light pollution can obscure celestial cues and disorient birds, drawing them off course and into hazardous urban environments. This is a primary factor in bird collisions with buildings, which are estimated to cause up to one billion bird deaths annually in the U.S. alone [https://environment.upenn.edu/news-events/events/bird-collisions-anthropocene-climate-week-2025, https://nycbirdalliance.org/our-work/conservation/project-safe-flight/artificial-light].\n    *   **Electromagnetic Noise:** Low-level electromagnetic noise from power lines, communication signals, and common electronic devices can disrupt the quantum-based radical-pair magnetic compass [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24805233/]. This interference can render the magnetic sense unusable in urban and suburban areas, forcing birds to rely on backup compass systems [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27313355].\n    *   **Climate Change:** Warming temperatures are causing a \"phenological mismatch,\" where the timing of migration is out of sync with the availability of critical food sources like insect hatches. Climate change is also altering habitats along migratory routes, which may force birds to adopt new, potentially longer and more dangerous, pathways.\n\n## Conclusion & Outlook\n\nAvian navigation is a masterful integration of physics, biology, and learning. Guided by the foundational map-and-compass model, research has revealed a multi-layered system where birds use the sun, stars, magnetic fields, and even smells to traverse the globe. The transition from an innate genetic program to a flexible, experience-based map highlights the sophisticated cognitive abilities of these animals.\n\nDespite significant progress, spearheaded by pioneers like Kramer, Emlen, and the Wiltschkos, key questions remain. The current frontiers of research are focused on uncovering the precise neurobiological mechanisms of magnetoreception and fully understanding the role of quantum mechanics\u2014specifically quantum entanglement\u2014in the radical-pair process [https://www.azoquantum.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=227]. Furthermore, emerging theories suggest birds may also use a long-distance \"acoustic map\" based on low-frequency infrasound generated by ocean waves and reflected by topography [https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.740027/full]. As our understanding deepens, so does the urgency to mitigate the growing array of anthropogenic disturbances that threaten these remarkable journeys.\n\n## References\n\n*

        "article": "# How to conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in the cislunar space, and support the effectiveness of short-term cislunar space tracking and monitoring tasks?\n\n# Deep Research Report: Achieving Comprehensive Situational Awareness in Cislunar Space\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe cislunar domain\u2014the vast region of space between Earth's geosynchronous orbit and the Moon\u2014is rapidly evolving from a quiet frontier into a strategic and commercially active environment. Driven by government initiatives like NASA's Artemis program and the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, alongside a growing number of commercial ventures, the population of spacecraft, rocket bodies, and debris in this region is set to increase dramatically. This report analyzes the multifaceted challenge of conducting comprehensive and accurate Space Situational Awareness (SSA) in this unique domain to support the effectiveness of short-term tracking and monitoring tasks.\n\nAchieving robust cislunar SSA requires a fundamental departure from the methods used for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous (GEO) regions. The primary challenges are the immense volume of space, the complex gravitational dynamics governed by the three-body problem, and the difficulty of detecting faint, distant objects. Current ground-based sensor networks are insufficient, providing only partial coverage with significant time gaps.\n\nThe solution lies in a multi-layered, system-of-systems approach. This includes deploying constellations of space-based sensors, leveraging a combination of advanced optical, radar, and passive RF technologies to overcome individual limitations. Computationally, this sensor network must be supported by specialized algorithms capable of initial orbit determination and trajectory prediction from sparse data in a multi-body environment, with collocation-based methods showing significant promise. Furthermore, addressing the critical data association problem for Too-Short Arcs (TSA) is essential for building a unified object catalog. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) will play a crucial role in optimizing sensor tasking, detecting anomalous behaviors, and assessing conjunctions.\n\nUltimately, technological advancements must be underpinned by a robust international policy framework for Cislunar Space Traffic Management (CSTM). While initiatives like the U.S. National Cislunar Science and Technology Strategy provide a roadmap, significant gaps in international consensus, data sharing agreements, and legal liability standards remain critical hurdles to ensuring the safe and sustainable use of cislunar space.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### The Cislunar Challenge: A New Paradigm for SSA\n\nUnlike the relatively predictable two-body mechanics that govern orbits in LEO and GEO, cislunar space is defined by the complex gravitational interactions of the Earth-Moon system, best modeled by the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). This dynamic environment introduces unique orbital classes, such as Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs) and Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs), which offer stability and accessibility for long-term missions like the Lunar Gateway [https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/Publications/Conferences/2017_IAA_ZimHowDav.pdf].\n\nHowever, these multi-body dynamics make tracking and prediction significantly more difficult. Debris from fragmentation events can scatter unpredictably far beyond its original orbit [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117724009189]. For high-fidelity predictions, models must often be expanded to a Restricted Four-Body Problem to account for the gravitational influence of the Sun and Jupiter. The primary challenges for cislunar SSA, therefore, shift from collision avoidance in a dense environment (LEO) to continuous detection and novel orbit determination across a vast and dynamically complex volume [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576524003308].\n\n### A Growing and Diverse Cislunar Population\n\nThe cislunar domain is on the cusp of a population boom. A survey of planned missions from 2024 to 2033 reveals extensive activity from a wide range of actors. The United States leads with NASA's Artemis program, multiple Department of Defense projects (e.g., AFRL's Defense Deep Space Sentinel), and a vibrant commercial sector including Quantum Space (10 orbital platforms), Firefly Aerospace (8 landers), and Blue Origin (4 landers). International participation is also significant, with China planning six missions and numerous other nations like Russia, the European Space Agency, Japan, and India contributing orbiters, landers, and rovers [0].\n\nThis growth introduces a diverse population of objects requiring tracking, from crewed spacecraft and stations to rocket bodies, debris, and low-thrust vehicles. The latter pose a particular challenge due to their faint signatures and continuous, low-acceleration trajectories, making them difficult to detect and monitor consistently [https://hanspeterschaub.info/Papers/grads/MichaelKlonowski.pdf, https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/us-military-wants-to-track-potential-threats-coming-from-the-moon].\n\n### Sensor Architectures: Overcoming Earth-Based Limitations\n\nExisting ground-based sensor networks, such as the Space Surveillance Network (SSN), are fundamentally inadequate for comprehensive cislunar SSA. Their limitations include restricted fields of view, weather dependency, and insufficient power to detect faint objects at extreme distances. Performance analysis shows that current ground systems achieve only 56.4% observability of the cislunar region, with tracking gaps as long as 24 hours [https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Poster/Bloom.pdf].\n\nA robust solution requires a multi-modal, layered sensor architecture, with a strong emphasis on space-based assets.\n*   **Optical Telescopes:** Considered the \"workhorse\" for cislunar SSA, they are cost-effective for long distances and provide excellent angular data. However, they cannot measure range and are limited by lighting conditions. Space-based optical sensors can overcome these limitations [0, 3, 7].\n*   **High-Power Radar:** While providing precise range and velocity data, radar effectiveness diminishes rapidly with distance due to the \"tyranny of the fourth power law,\" making it prohibitively power-intensive for most cislunar applications [3, 8].\n*   **Passive RF Sensing:** This technique is highly effective for characterizing active, transmitting satellites but is useless for tracking debris or non-cooperative, inactive objects [3, 6, 9].\n\nTo achieve continuous detection, particularly of faint objects, advanced processing initiatives like DARPA's \"Track at Big Distances with Track-Before-Detect (TBD2)\" program are developing new methods for processing optical signals from space-based platforms [https://sam.gov/opp/43a52cc42f5f420bb0c11452ace42d6f/view]. Furthermore, academic frameworks using concepts like the \"facility location problem\" are being explored to optimize the placement of sensor constellations in strategic locations, such as orbits around Lagrange points [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383060120_Cislunar_Constellation_Design_for_Space_Situational_Awareness_with_Time-Expanded_Facility_Location_Problem].\n\n### Advanced Algorithms and AI: The Computational Backbone\n\nThe sparse data expected from cislunar sensors necessitates a new generation of algorithms for orbit determination and catalog maintenance.\n*   **Initial Orbit Determination (IOD):** Traditional methods like the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) are often insufficient. Research indicates that **collocation-based IOD algorithms** are highly reliable, demonstrating superior accuracy and convergence for reconstructing multi-body orbits from sparse optical data over short arcs. Other advanced techniques include Differential Corrections algorithms and MCCLOD [Source: algorithms for cislunar initial orbit determination...].\n*   **Data Correlation and Cataloging:** A major research gap is the data association problem, particularly for Too-Short Arc (TSA) observations where traditional IOD fails. Maintaining a unified catalog requires novel **tracklet association methods** that integrate admissible regions with nonlinear approaches to link disparate observations to a single object [https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.G008069].\n*   **AI and Machine Learning:** AI/ML offers powerful tools to automate and optimize cislunar SSA. Specific applications include:\n    *   **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** for intelligent sensor tasking to maximize object discovery [https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Poster/Siew.pdf].\n    *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for detecting subtle satellite maneuvers [https://amostech.space/track/machine-learning-for-ssa-applications/].\n    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for complex tasks like conjunction assessment and object characterization [https://amostech.space/track/machine-learning-for-ssa-applications/].\n\n### Direct Applications for Short-Term Monitoring and Threat Assessment\n\nComprehensive cislunar SSA directly supports critical short-term tasks, including collision avoidance and rendezvous/proximity operations (RPO), which rely on precise state estimation using linearized CR3BP dynamic models [https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/10/8/674]. Beyond safety, SSA is crucial for threat assessment and characterizing the behavior of non-cooperative targets. Observable behaviors that can indicate intent include:\n*   **High-Velocity Maneuvers:** Fuel-intensive maneuvers, like the 44 m/s burn by China's TJS-2 satellite, suggest advanced capability or urgent repositioning.\n*   **Unusual Orbital Positioning:** Maneuvering to create shadows, as demonstrated by China's TJS-4, can indicate an attempt to blind an adversary's surveillance satellite.\n*   **Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO):** Close-approach operations, such as those conducted by Chinese and Russian satellites, could be for servicing, refueling, or inspection.\n*   **Entry into Coplanar Orbits:** A satellite matching the orbital plane of another nation's asset, like Russia's Cosmos 2576 did with a U.S. satellite, is a notable event requiring characterization.\n*   **Complex Flight Patterns:** Unconventional movements, such as the \"corkscrew maneuvers\" performed by Chinese satellites, can reveal advanced operational capabilities.\nFurthermore, strategic placement of monitoring assets in DROs can enable rapid rendezvous with targets in NRHOs, supporting responsive monitoring or rescue missions [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468896724000557].\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### Sensor and Algorithm Interdependencies\n\nThe effectiveness of a cislunar SSA architecture hinges on the synergy between its sensor hardware and its processing software. The vast distances and complex physics of the domain mean that no single sensor or algorithm can provide a complete solution. Optical systems, the primary detection method, generate angle-only data (azimuth/elevation) that is inherently ambiguous in range. This creates a critical need for either a) fusion with range-providing sensors like radar or passive RF, which are range-limited or target-dependent, or b) highly sophisticated IOD algorithms that can resolve an orbit from sparse, angle-only measurements.\n\nThe prominence of collocation-based IOD algorithms is a direct response to this challenge. Unlike traditional shooting methods or filters like the EKF, which can struggle to converge without a good initial guess, collocation methods reconstruct an entire trajectory segment that best fits the sparse observations. This makes them more robust to the long observational gaps and limited data inherent to cislunar tracking.\n\nHowever, even with advanced IOD, the fundamental problem of linking tracklets\u2014short arcs of observational data\u2014remains. This \"Too-Short Arc\" (TSA) problem is a major bottleneck in catalog creation. A novel tracklet association method that combines geometric constraints (admissible regions) with nonlinear dynamics is a proposed solution, but this remains an active area of research and a critical gap in capability [https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.G008069]. While the research logs identified Encke's method as a computational technique for trajectory propagation, specific details on its application to CR3BP and R4BP models using sparse data were not available in the provided sources.\n\n### The Policy and International Collaboration Imperative\n\nTechnology alone is insufficient. The successful management of cislunar space requires a robust Cislunar Space Traffic Management (CSTM) framework. Currently, this framework is nascent and faces significant political hurdles. The research highlights a lack of international consensus on the urgency of the problem, an absence of legally binding data sharing agreements, and no agreed-upon standards for collision avoidance liability [https://www.unoosa.org/res/oosadoc/data/documents/2025/aac_105c_2_2025crp/aac_105c_2_2025crp_23_0_html/AC105_C2_2025_CRP23E.pdf]. Initiatives like \"The Cologne Manual on Space Traffic Management\" are important steps, but they are not binding regulations. Without shared data and established norms of behavior, distinguishing between routine operations, anomalous behavior, and outright threats becomes exponentially more difficult, increasing the risk of miscalculation and conflict.\n\n## Conclusion & Outlook\n\nAchieving comprehensive and accurate situational awareness in cislunar space is a grand challenge that requires a paradigm shift in technology, algorithms, and international policy. The path forward is not through a single breakthrough but through the integrated development of a system-of-systems.\n\nThe roadmap laid out by the U.S. National Cislunar Science and Technology Strategy provides a clear direction, prioritizing investment in R&D, international cooperation, and the extension of SSA capabilities beyond GEO [https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11-2022-NSTC-National-Cislunar-ST-Strategy.pdf]. Key investment priorities must focus on deploying space-based sensor constellations, maturing advanced IOD and data fusion algorithms to handle sparse data in multi-body regimes, and operationalizing AI/ML for autonomous sensor management and pattern-of-life analysis.\n\nIn the coming decade, as the cislunar population grows, the ability to track, monitor, and characterize objects will become a cornerstone of space safety, scientific discovery, and national security. Success will depend not only on deploying advanced hardware and software but also on fostering an international framework of transparency and data sharing to ensure that cislunar space remains a sustainable and accessible domain for all.\n\n## References\n\nA complete list of sources is available in the raw research logs.

        "article": "# Which Obsidian plugins can effectively replicate Notion's multi-view database functionality (including Table, Kanban, Calendar, and List views)? Please provide a detailed comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of these plugins.\n\n# Deep Research Report: Replicating Notion's Multi-View Databases in Obsidian\n\n**Report Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Chief Research Editor, Autonomous AI Research Service\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis report analyzes the Obsidian plugin ecosystem to determine the most effective methods for replicating the multi-view database functionality of Notion, specifically its Table, Kanban, Calendar, and List views. The research reveals that while no single plugin perfectly mirrors Notion's seamless, integrated experience, a combination of powerful plugins can achieve similar results.\n\nUsers must choose between two primary strategies: the **'All-in-One' approach**, which relies on a single, comprehensive plugin like **Obsidian Projects**, and the **'Modular' approach**, which combines specialized plugins such as **Database Folder**, **Dataview**, and **Full Calendar**. A third, simpler workflow is offered by the core plugin **Bases**, which provides embeddable, no-code database blocks for less complex use cases.\n\nThe 'All-in-One' approach offers a more cohesive user experience and simpler setup, with native support for most views, including a calendar. The 'Modular' approach provides greater flexibility and power but comes with increased setup complexity, a steeper learning curve, and the need to manage inter-plugin dependencies. The choice between them hinges on a user's technical comfort and specific needs for customization versus ease of use. This difference is rooted in the fundamental architectural contrast between Notion\u2019s centralized model and Obsidian\u2019s decentralized, file-based system.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### 1. The Notion Database Baseline\n\nTo effectively evaluate Obsidian's capabilities, we first established a baseline of Notion's core database functionality. A Notion database is a single data source that can be visualized through multiple, switchable views. Key features include:\n*   **Multiple Views:** The ability to display the same set of data as a Table, Kanban board, Calendar, or List.\n*   **Rich Properties:** A wide range of data types for columns, including Text, Number, Select, Multi-select, Date, Files, URL, Relation, and Rollup.\n*   **Dynamic Controls:** Powerful, per-view filtering, sorting, and grouping capabilities that allow for customized data presentation.\n*   **Seamless Interaction:** The ability to edit data in any view, with changes instantly reflected across all other views of that database.\n\n### 2. Two Primary Strategies for Replication in Obsidian\n\nOur research indicates that users must adopt one of two distinct strategies to replicate this functionality, each with significant trade-offs.\n\n*   **The 'All-in-One' Strategy:** This approach uses a single, feature-rich plugin to handle all database views and management. **Obsidian Projects** is the leading plugin for this strategy, providing an integrated experience with native support for Table, Kanban, and Calendar views.\n*   **The 'Modular' Strategy:** This approach involves combining several specialized plugins, each excelling at a specific function. A typical modular stack includes **Dataview** as the core query engine, **Database Folder** for Table and Kanban views, and **Full Calendar** for the Calendar view. This offers high customization at the cost of complexity.\n\nA third, noteworthy option is the **'Embeddable' Strategy** using Obsidian's core **Bases** plugin, which focuses on providing simple, editable, no-code database blocks that can be placed directly within notes.\n\n### 3. Core Plugin Capabilities and Inter-dependencies\n\n*   **Dataview (Core Query Engine):** Dataview is a foundational plugin that enables many other database solutions. It uses a SQL-like query language (DQL) to pull metadata from note frontmatter and inline fields to generate dynamic tables and lists. It is highly flexible but lacks a graphical user interface (GUI) for creating views, requiring users to write queries manually.\n*   **Obsidian Projects (All-in-One):** This plugin is the closest equivalent to a self-contained Notion database. It sources notes from folders or tags and presents them in built-in Table, Board (Kanban), and Calendar views. It offers a unified interface for managing data within Obsidian.\n*   **Database Folder (Modular Core):** This powerful plugin creates full-pane, highly customizable database views, including tables and Kanban boards. It features interactive editing, where changes in the view are saved back to the source notes. Crucially, **Database Folder is dependent on the Dataview plugin to function**. It does not have a native Calendar view.\n*   **Full Calendar (Specialized View):** A dedicated plugin for creating calendar views. It sources events from note frontmatter and integrates with other plugins like Dataview and Tasks. It is the essential Calendar component for the 'Modular' strategy.\n*   **Bases (Embeddable Solution):** As an official core plugin, Bases provides a user-friendly, no-code method for creating embeddable database blocks. It supports Table, List, and \"Cards\" (Kanban) layouts and allows direct editing of note properties from the view. It currently lacks a native Calendar view.\n\n### 4. Integration Challenges in the Modular Approach\n\nThe 'Modular' strategy's primary weakness is the loose integration between its components. Research found **no documented workflow for a direct, seamless integration between Database Folder and Full Calendar**. While Full Calendar can pull data using Dataview (which Database Folder also relies on), achieving a truly unified experience where all views (Table, Kanban, Calendar) feel like different facets of a single database requires significant manual configuration and may not be fully possible. This contrasts sharply with the cohesive experience offered by Notion or the Obsidian Projects plugin.\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### Comparative Matrix: All-in-One vs. Modular Approach\n\n| Feature | Notion (Baseline) | 'All-in-One' (Obsidian Projects) | 'Modular' (Database Folder + Full Calendar) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Table View** | Native, Fully Featured | \u2705 Native, Integrated | \u2705 Native (via Database Folder) |\n| **Kanban View** | Native, Fully Featured | \u2705 Native, Integrated | \u2705 Native (via Database Folder) |\n| **Calendar View** | Native, Fully Featured | \u2705 Native, Integrated | \u274c **Requires Integration** with a specialized plugin like Full Calendar. |\n| **List View** | Native, Fully Featured | \u2705 Achieved via core table functionality | \u2705 Achieved via Database Folder or Dataview |\n| **Ease of Setup** | N/A | High (Single plugin installation) | Low (Requires installing and configuring 3+ plugins and their dependencies) |\n| **UI/UX Cohesion** | Very High | High (All views are within a single interface) | Medium (Views exist in separate plugins; experience can be disjointed) |\n| **Filtering/Sorting** | Advanced, per-view | Advanced, Integrated | Very High (Leverages Dataview's powerful query engine) |\n| **Data Portability** | Medium (Requires export) | High (Data remains in plain Markdown files) | High (Data remains in plain Markdown files) |\n\n### Analysis of Workflows\n\n**1. The 'All-in-One' Workflow (Obsidian Projects)**\n\nThis workflow is the most straightforward and Notion-like.\n1.  **Setup:** Install the Obsidian Projects plugin.\n2.  **Creation:** Create a new project, defining the data source (e.g., `folder: \"Projects\"` or `tag: #project`).\n3.  **Interaction:** The plugin automatically populates a database with notes matching the source. Users can then switch between pre-built Table, Board, and Calendar tabs within the same project view. Creating a new note from any view (e.g., clicking a date in the calendar) uses templates to ensure consistent metadata.\n*   **Strengths:** Simplicity, feature cohesiveness, and minimal setup overhead.\n*   **Weaknesses:** Less flexible than the modular approach; users are limited to the features provided by the single plugin.\n\n**2. The 'Modular' Workflow (Database Folder + Dataview + Full Calendar)**\n\nThis workflow offers maximum power but requires technical configuration.\n1.  **Setup:** Install Dataview, Database Folder, and Full Calendar. Ensure all are enabled and configured.\n2.  **Creation & Interaction:**\n    *   **Table/Kanban:** Create a \"Database Folder\" and configure its source (e.g., `folder: \"Projects\"`) to generate interactive Table and Kanban views. This experience is confined to the full-pane view of the Database Folder plugin.\n    *   **Calendar:** Separately, configure the Full Calendar plugin to source events from the same location (e.g., notes in the \"Projects\" folder with a specific date in their frontmatter).\n3.  **The Gap:** There is no single \"database\" entity to switch views on. The user must navigate between the Database Folder note (for Table/Kanban) and the Full Calendar view (for Calendar), which are functionally separate parts of the UI.\n*   **Strengths:** Extreme customization and power, leveraging the best features of specialized tools.\n*   **Weaknesses:** High setup complexity, potential points of failure due to dependencies, and a disjointed user experience compared to Notion.\n\n**3. The 'Embeddable' Workflow (Bases Core Plugin)**\n\nThis workflow prioritizes simplicity and integration within notes.\n1.  **Setup:** Enable the core 'Bases' plugin.\n2.  **Creation:** Create a `base` code block within any note, specifying the data source and desired columns.\n3.  **Interaction:** The rendered block provides an editable Table or Card (Kanban) view directly inside the note. It is ideal for managing small, contextual datasets without a dedicated, full-screen interface.\n*   **Strengths:** No-code setup, official core support, and excellent for embedding data alongside other text.\n*   **Weaknesses:** Limited native views (no Calendar) and less powerful than the dedicated solutions.\n\n## Conclusion & Outlook\n\nObsidian can effectively replicate Notion's multi-view database functionality, but it requires a conscious choice between fundamentally different philosophies. The decentralized, file-based nature of Obsidian means that data aggregation and visualization are handled by layers of plugins, unlike Notion's inherently database-centric architecture.\n\n*   For users prioritizing **ease of use and a cohesive, Notion-like experience**, the **'All-in-One' approach with Obsidian Projects** is the clear recommendation. It provides the most important views in a single, integrated package with minimal setup.\n\n*   For **power users who demand maximum flexibility, customization, and control**, the **'Modular' approach** (Database Folder, Dataview, Full Calendar) is superior. This path requires a willingness to manage complexity and dependencies in exchange for the ability to build a highly tailored system.\n\n*   For users with **simpler needs or who want to embed editable data within notes**, the core **Bases** plugin offers an accessible, no-code solution that handles basic Table and Kanban needs effectively.\n\nThe Obsidian ecosystem is constantly evolving. As one source noted, it is plausible that a future plugin may emerge to bridge the gap between the 'All-in-One' and 'Modular' approaches, offering the best of both worlds. For now, the optimal solution depends entirely on the individual user's technical proficiency and project management requirements.\n\n## References\n\n*   medium.com/technology-hits/my-obsidian-setup-part-14-database-folder-plugin-932fe2e360ad\n*   youtube.com/watch?v=lIuZAik1jPM\n*   youtube.com/watch?v=OYJgDZomOyo\n*   youtube.com/watch?v=rGFb6j9KDh4\n*   youtube.com/watch?v=XcRfWm8oQZc\n\n## Citations \n- https://thomasjfrank.com/notion-databases-the-ultimate-beginners-guide/\n- https://www.notion.com/help/views-filters-and-sorts\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAJOpO73d8Y\n- https://docs.notionapps.com/customize-app/customize-a-screen/filtering-sorting-items\n- https://bullet.so/blog/how-to-master-notion-databases/\n- https://obsidian.md/plugins\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny8lksaQ5A8\n- https://forum.obsidian.md/t/its-time-to-add-databases-now-that-tables-are-fully-supported-time-to-overthrow-notion/78428\n- https://forum.obsidian.md/t/what-are-the-differences-between-various-database-plugins/39406\n- https://www.jordanrobison.net/p/the-obsidian-projects-plugin-my-secret-weapon-for-staying-organized-and-focused\n- https://notionstate.com/properties-of-a-notion-database/\n- https://www.notion.vip/insights/notion-explained-relations-rollups\n- https://theorganizednotebook.com/blogs/blog/database-properties-notion?srsltid=AfmBOopcHBjw734gOh7GiW8vVQDL60o-37p7-YhYOslPauP61vvMa7wT\n- https://carlosrayala.com/notion-databases-mastery-your-comprehensive-guide/\n- https://www.notion.com/help/relations-and-rollups\n- https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/obsidian-playbook/Obsidian+Plugins/Community+Plugins/dataview/Dataview+plugin\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcSoHtRadn8\n- https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/dql-js-inline/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/117fo3x/obsidian_dataview_plugin_tutorial_101/\n- https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/\n- https://marcusolsson.dev/announcing-obsidian-projects/\n- https://www.workings.co/p/first-look-the-projects-plugin\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vihPqFnM0dU&vl=en\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B0s6PCdHZo\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcRfWm8oQZc\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LsJhDsQBRY\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOLB1vVsLp0\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGFb6j9KDh4\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1n5qguc/i_made_a_plugin_to_display_any_data_as/\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIuZAik1jPM\n- https://medium.com/technology-hits/my-obsidian-setup-part-14-database-folder-plugin-932fe2e360ad\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGFb6j9KDh4\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJgDZomOyo\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcRfWm8oQZc\n- https://help.obsidian.md/bases/create-base\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWUQbK8KlOo\n- https://forum.obsidian.md/t/new-plugin-edit-transcluded-embedded-notes-blocks-in-place/106257\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1njvm7x/i_made_a_plugin_for_live_editable_note_embeds_any/\n- https://help.obsidian.md/bases\n- https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/every-day-calendar\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/t5p2r1/how_to_create_a_calendar_view_for_nondaily_notes/\n- https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=Calendar\n- https://practicalpkm.com/building-a-content-calendar-in-obsidian-bases/\n- https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-full-calendar\n- https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-full-calendar\n- https://medium.com/@geetduggal/tech-habits-obsidian-kanban-and-full-calendar-integration-a05a7ff2d2f6\n- https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=Calendar\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJgDZomOyo\n- https://forum.obsidian.md/t/full-calendar-plugin-replicate-google-calendar-in-your-vault/32584"

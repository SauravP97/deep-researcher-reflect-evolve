Search Query: quadcopter cascaded PID attitude control architecture inner loop rate control outer loop angle control
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, the standard approach to UAV attitude control involves a cascaded PID architecture, which is generally easier to stabilize compared to a single-loop controller. This system is typically divided into two interconnected loops: an outer loop for angle control and an inner loop for angular rate control.

The structure and function of this cascaded system are as follows:

*   **Outer Loop (Angle Control):** This loop is responsible for managing the UAV's attitude (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw angles). It typically uses a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. When there is an error between the desired attitude and the actual attitude, the outer loop generates a command for the desired angular rate.
*   **Inner Loop (Rate Control):** This loop receives the angular rate command from the outer loop and works to achieve it. It usually employs a full Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to manage the angular velocity. The entire cascaded structure is sometimes referred to as a P-PID controller.

**Key Principles for Performance and Stability:**

*   **Interaction and Integration:** This architecture leverages the UAV's natural dynamics, where there is an inherent integration between angular rate and attitude. An attitude error in the outer loop creates a rate command, and the integrator in the inner loop's PID controller works to eliminate any steady-state attitude offset. This is why an integrator is not strictly necessary in the outer angle control loop.
*   **Loop Speed:** For the system to be stable and effective, the inner rate control loop must operate at a higher frequency than the outer angle loop. This allows for tight tracking of the rate commands and ensures overall system stability.
*   **Broader Application:** This cascaded attitude control is often a component of a larger control system for a 6-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) UAV. Such a system might use multiple PID controllers (e.g., six in total) to stabilize both the vehicle's altitude and its angular position.

Search Query: quadcopter mathematical model limitations of fixed PID gains under varying mass aerodynamic effects and wind disturbances
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating in diverse flight states, several advanced methods can be employed beyond using a single set of fixed parameters [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334775957_Optimizing_PID_controller_gains_to_model_the_performance_of_a_quadcopter, https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4591/87/1/93].

The foundational approach to PID control involves modeling the quadcopter's dynamics, often using Newton's equations, to provide a basis for tuning the controller gains [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334775957_Optimizing_PID_controller_gains_to_model_the_performance_of_a_quadcopter, https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4591/87/1/93]. However, fixed-gain PID controllers face challenges with external disturbances such as wind turbulence [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772671124004169, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360410400_Aerodynamic_Modelling_and_Wind_Disturbance_Rejection_of_Multirotor_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles]. To overcome these limitations, the following methods are proposed:

*   **Optimized Adaptive PID Controllers:** This approach adjusts the PID parameters in real-time to adapt to changing flight conditions, making it effective for complex tasks such as trajectory tracking [https://www.scribd.com/document/706250461/30].
*   **Robust Control Methods:** These methods are specifically designed to handle uncertainties and external disturbances, offering a way to counter factors like wind and improve overall system stability [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360410400_Aerodynamic_Modelling_and_Wind_Disturbance_Rejection_of_Multirotor_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles].
*   **Cascade Model Predictive Control (MPC):** As a more advanced alternative, cascade MPC has demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional PID controllers. It excels in providing better stability and disturbance rejection, particularly in challenging and turbulent windy conditions [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772671124004169].

Search Query: PID gain scheduling for UAV attitude control implementation with lookup tables scheduling variables (airspeed, throttle) advantages and disadvantages
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms for UAVs operating across diverse flight states, Gain-Scheduling PID (GS-PID) control is an effective method. This approach addresses the limitation of a single set of PID parameters by adjusting them based on the UAV's current operating conditions.

**How Gain-Scheduling PID Works**

The core idea of GS-PID is to have multiple sets of PID parameters, with each set tuned for a specific flight condition. The system then selects the optimal set of gains in real-time. This is often implemented using a lookup table or a scheduler block that retrieves PID gains from an array. The selection is based on breakpoint data corresponding to the system's current state, which can be defined by variables such as airspeed or throttle [https://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/ug/pidgainscheduler.html].

**Implementation for UAVs**

GS-PID is particularly well-suited for the complex, multivariable, and nonlinear nature of systems like quad-rotor UAVs [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326490598_Gain_Scheduling_Based_PID_Control_Approaches_for_Path_Tracking_and_Fault_Tolerant_Control_of_a_Quad-rotor_UAV]. For attitude control, it is common to implement multiple gain-scheduled PID controllers in a cascaded structure, allowing for precise management of each control element [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317040874_Gain_Scheduled_Attitude_Control_of_Fixed-Wing_UAV_With_Automatic_Controller_Tuning].

**Advantages and Optimal Selection**

By dynamically adjusting PID parameters, this method allows the controller to maintain high performance across different flight states, which is a significant improvement over a fixed-gain controller. The primary advantages highlighted by research include:

*   **Improved Path Tracking:** The adaptability of the controller leads to more accurate flight path following.
*   **Enhanced Fault-Tolerant Control:** The system can better handle unexpected changes or partial system failures.

Optimal selection of PID parameters involves designing and tuning different sets of gains for various operating points (e.g., low speed, high speed, hover) and then storing them in the lookup table. The controller then interpolates between these points to ensure smooth transitions as the UAV's state changes. While the provided sources detail the benefits, they do not specify any disadvantages of this method [https://www.ijmerr.com/uploadfile/2018/0709/20180709111619835.pdf].

Search Query: Fuzzy Logic PID controller architecture for UAV attitude control detailing fuzzification rule base and defuzzification for Kp Ki Kd tuning
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms for UAVs operating under diverse flight conditions, a fuzzy logic algorithm can be integrated with a standard PID controller to create a self-tuning system [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387657973_Self-Tuning_PID_Controller_for_Quadcopter_using_Fuzzy_Logic]. This approach addresses the limitation of a single set of PID parameters, which typically perform well only under specific flight conditions.

The core of this method is an adaptable fuzzy control mechanism that uses a fuzzy PID rule base to continuously adjust the controller gains (e.g., Kp, Ki, Kd) for manipulating the UAV's mechanical actuators [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fuzzy-PID-rule-base-for-K-df-gain_tbl4_363776496, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220312345_Fuzzy_PID_controller_Design_performance_evaluation_and_stability_analysis]. This allows the controller to adapt its performance to changing flight states.

Several architectural approaches for implementing this have been proposed:
*   **Decoupling Control:** One design utilizes a decoupling fuzzy controller to effectively separate the control of the UAV's position from its orientation, simplifying the control problem [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fe28504483b86768926d08d340241fbc4fa62f72].
*   **Modular Systems:** More comprehensive systems can be designed with multiple fuzzy logic modules to manage both flight control and autonomous navigation tasks [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234025186_Fuzzy_Logic_Based_Approach_to_Design_of_Flight_Control_and_Navigation_Tasks_for_Autonomous_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles].

Regarding the optimal selection of PID parameters, this fuzzy logic approach enables dynamic, real-time tuning rather than a single optimal selection. However, the provided information does not detail the specific architecture, fuzzification, rule base design, or defuzzification processes required for implementing the tuning of Kp, Ki, and Kd gains.

Search Query: Neural Network PID tuning for UAV attitude control architectures for online gain optimization
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms for UAVs across diverse flight states, neural networks can be employed for online, adaptive PID gain tuning. Several architectures have been proposed for this purpose.

One approach utilizes a single-layer neural network, which may contain around 10 hidden neurons. This network uses the proportional, integral, and derivative errors as inputs to adjust the PID gains for the UAV's pitch/roll (y) and yaw (ψ) states.

A more complex integrated framework involves using an Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (ISSA) to optimize the weights of a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN). The optimized BPNN then enables adaptive PID tuning. When this ISSA-BP-PID system is combined with a Linear Extended State Observer (LESO) to compensate for disturbances, it has been shown to improve the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 33.4% under uncertain flight conditions, thereby enhancing robustness.

Other related research in this area includes comparing the performance of a direct inverse control artificial neural network (DIC-ANN) with that of a traditional PID controller.

However, a critical perspective suggests that while using a neural network as an online tuner is feasible, the performance improvement may be small. Consequently, the added implementation complexity might not be justified in all applications.

Search Query: offline PID tuning for UAV attitude control using Genetic Algorithm or Particle Swarm Optimization cost function simulation
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms for UAVs across diverse flight states, various offline tuning methods can be employed to find optimal controller parameters. These methods often utilize simulation models of the UAV, for instance in Simulink, to test and refine the parameters before practical application.

The primary approaches for optimizing PID parameters include:
*   **Meta-heuristic Algorithms**: Techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) are commonly used to search for optimal controller gain parameters. These algorithms are effective at navigating complex problem spaces to find robust solutions.
*   **Hybrid Algorithms**: Some approaches combine multiple methods to leverage their respective strengths, such as a hybrid of Particle Swarm Optimization with a Memory-based Gravitational Search Algorithm.
*   **Intelligent Controllers**: Neural networks, like a Levenberg-Marquardt feedforward neural network, can be used to create intelligent PID controllers that adapt more effectively.

The process of selecting optimal parameters is guided by a cost or fitness function that the chosen algorithm aims to minimize. The central goal is to find controller gains that stabilize the UAV's attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) and thrust, especially under disturbances like wind gusts or physical defects.

A well-defined fitness function is crucial for achieving desired performance. This function often combines several key metrics, such as:
*   Minimizing the error in the UAV's attitude rate.
*   Integrating the weighted absolute error time with other critical performance indicators like overshoot, rise time, and settling time.

Search Query: UAV fuzzy PID tuning process membership functions for error and delta-error IF-THEN rule base examples defuzzification methods Center of Gravity
Search Answer: To enhance the performance of PID control algorithms for UAVs operating across diverse flight states, fuzzy PID tuning can be employed. This method adapts the controller's parameters to varying conditions, addressing the limitations of a single set of PID parameters.

The fuzzy PID tuning process involves the following steps:
1.  **Fuzzification**: Membership functions are established for controller inputs, such as error and the rate of change of error (delta-error) [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Membership-functions-of-the-error-for-the-fuzzy-PID-controller_fig4_276509370, https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fuzzy-membership-function-for-error_fig4_388313885].
2.  **Fuzzy Inference**: The fuzzified inputs are processed through a predefined IF-THEN rule base [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Membership-functions-of-the-error-for-the-fuzzy-PID-controller_fig4_276509370, https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fuzzy-membership-function-for-error_fig4_388313885].
3.  **Defuzzification**: This final step converts the fuzzy output from the inference stage back into a crisp, specific signal that the controller can use to make adjustments [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Membership-functions-of-the-error-for-the-fuzzy-PID-controller_fig4_276509370].

Several defuzzification methods can be used to determine the final controller output. Common methods include:
*   Center of Gravity (COG) / Centroid of Area (COA) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etFR1xwvd7w, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwafDor2g6A]
*   Center of Sums Method (COS) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etFR1xwvd7w]
*   Max Membership Principle [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwafDor2g6A]
*   Weighted Average Method [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwafDor2g6A]
*   Mean Max [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwafDor2g6A]

Among these, the Center of Gravity (COG) method is a frequently used technique [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Membership-functions-of-the-error-for-the-fuzzy-PID-controller_fig4_276509370, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etFR1xwvd7w]. The formula for calculating the defuzzified value (x*) using COG differs for discrete and continuous membership functions [https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~dsamanta/courses/archive/sca/Archives/Chapter%205%20Defuzzification%20Methods.pdf]:
*   **For discrete membership functions**: x* = ∑(xᵢ * μ(xᵢ)) / ∑μ(xᵢ), where xᵢ is the sample element and μ(xᵢ) is its membership function.
*   **For continuous membership functions**: x* = ∫(x * μₐ(x) dx) / ∫μₐ(x) dx.

Search Query: UAV attitude control using Sliding Mode Control (SMC) hybrid PID-SMC structure robustness against disturbances
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of UAVs beyond what a single set of PID parameters can offer across diverse flight states, hybrid control strategies are employed to improve robustness against disturbances. A prominent approach involves combining Sliding Mode Control (SMC) with other advanced algorithms.

Several proposed hybrid methods include:
*   **Fusion with Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC):** One method fuses ADRC with Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control (ST-SMC). This combination has demonstrated superior performance in dynamic response, disturbance rejection, and steady-state tracking error when compared to traditional PID and standalone ADRC controllers [https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/9/5124]. A similar strategy integrates linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) with SMC for the attitude control of small fixed-wing UAVs [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382213105_Attitude_Control_of_Small_Fixed-Wing_UAV_Based_on_Sliding_Mode_and_Linear_Active_Disturbance_Rejection_Control].

The concept of using SMC in hybrid systems for robust attitude control extends to other applications, such as spacecraft, where it has been combined with productive networks (PN) [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997IJSyS..28..435C/abstract].

Direct comparisons indicate that SMC, particularly when used with disturbance observers, shows distinct advantages over PID controllers that lack such observers, highlighting its enhanced ability to handle external disturbances [https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:bz617b344/fulltext.pdf]. These advanced control structures offer a robust alternative to overcome the limitations of single-parameter PID controllers in varied flight conditions.

Search Query: "Model Predictive Control" UAV attitude control benefits "computational complexity" comparison PID SMC
Search Answer: While single-set PID controllers are simple to implement, their performance is often limited to specific flight conditions. To enhance control performance across the diverse flight states encountered by UAVs, more advanced control strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) can be employed, both of which demonstrate superior performance compared to PID.

**Model Predictive Control (MPC)**

MPC offers significant advantages for UAV attitude control, including better trajectory tracking, less overshoot, faster settling times, and increased robustness against external disturbances [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]. A key benefit of MPC is its ability to handle constraints on system states and inputs, making it particularly effective for optimizing performance during aggressive maneuvers [1, 8].

However, the primary drawback of MPC is its high computational cost and complexity, which stems from its reliance on online optimization [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This computational burden is greater than that of both PID and SMC controllers and presents a major challenge for real-time implementation on the embedded systems with limited processing power found in most small UAVs, often requiring more powerful hardware [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]. To mitigate this issue, research into variants like Explicit MPC (EMPC) aims to provide performance superior to PID and SMC but with lower computational complexity [7].

**Sliding Mode Control (SMC)**

SMC is another alternative that demonstrates better performance than PID controllers. It can provide a faster response, less overshoot, and superior robustness in rejecting external disturbances [4, 8, 10]. While sources confirm that MPC is computationally more demanding than SMC, they do not provide a detailed comparison of SMC's computational complexity relative to MPC [5, 6, 8, 10].

Search Query: PX4 ArduPilot Autotune PID tuning algorithm implementation and comparison
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms for UAVs operating across diverse flight states, open-source flight controllers like PX4 and ArduPilot have implemented automatic tuning (autotune) features for selecting optimal parameters.

### PX4 Autotune

The PX4 autopilot firmware includes an automatic tuning feature for multicopter, fixed-wing, and VTOL vehicles. This system utilizes the OCTUNE algorithm to tune its PID control loops [https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/23/9240, https://docs.px4.io/v1.14/en/config/autotune]. The tuning process varies by vehicle type:
*   **For fixed-wing aircraft**, new tuning gains are applied and tested while the vehicle is in the air. The system includes a safety feature that automatically reverts to the previous parameters if the new controllers are unstable.
*   **For multicopters**, the vehicle must land after the tuning flight. The new parameters are applied after the vehicle is disarmed, and the pilot must then take off again to test the new tuning [https://docs.px4.io/v1.14/en/config/autotune].

### ArduPilot Autotune

ArduPilot (APM:Copter) also features a well-known autotune function. Community discussions have considered porting this function to PX4, but the process was deemed very difficult [https://discuss.px4.io/t/how-to-autotune-the-pid-params/3395]. Some users have characterized the ArduPilot tuning as potentially "a bit 'rough' for many frames" [https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/8472]. The ArduPilot autotune algorithm was originally implemented in MATLAB and simulated with PID and PD controllers [https://engrxiv.org/preprint/download/4462/7760/6405].

### Alternative Methods

In addition to in-flight autotuning, the PX4 development community has discussed an alternative approach for optimizing PID parameters. This method involves using data from flight logs to design improved controllers offline [https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/8472]. This approach avoids some of the challenges of real-time tuning and allows for more detailed analysis. Another suggestion has been to implement an incremental tuning process that occurs over a longer flight time, which might yield better results than a more aggressive, short-term tuning session [https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/8472].

Search Query: comparative analysis of UAV adaptive PID control methods "computational cost" "implementation complexity" "model reliance" "robustness"
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) across diverse flight states, several advanced methods can be employed. These approaches move beyond a single, fixed set of PID parameters by dynamically adapting the control strategy.

Based on the provided information, here are methods to improve PID performance and optimize parameter selection:

*   **Intelligent PID:** This is a general category of methods developed to offer better robustness for control systems compared to traditional PID controllers.

*   **Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC):** This method improves adaptability and robustness by using human-like reasoning to adjust control parameters. It is a proven technique in related fields like autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).

*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL enables a system to autonomously learn optimal control policies through interaction with its environment. This enhances tracking precision and decision-making capabilities, especially under uncertain or changing conditions. One specific type of RL is the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), for which computational cost has been analyzed.

*   **Hybrid Approaches:** These methods combine the strengths of different techniques to improve resilience against uncertainties and faults. Examples include:
    *   **Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS):** This approach merges the reliability of model-based systems with the adaptability of data-driven methods.
    *   **Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PI-RL):** Similar to ANFIS, this technique integrates physical models with reinforcement learning to enhance performance.

**Considerations for Selecting a Method:**

*   **Robustness and Adaptability:** Methods like FLC, RL, and hybrid approaches (ANFIS, PI-RL) are specifically designed to improve these characteristics.
*   **Computational Cost:** This is a critical factor for real-time implementation. Comparative analyses have been conducted for some methods, such as the DDPG reinforcement learning algorithm.
*   **Model Reliance:** Reinforcement Learning allows the system to learn directly from environmental interactions, while hybrid approaches like ANFIS and PI-RL effectively merge model-based reliability with data-driven adaptability.

It is important to note that the provided documents do not contain information regarding the implementation complexity of these methods.

Search Query: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for UAV attitude control implementation and robustness analysis
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms for UAVs across diverse flight states, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) can be employed. ANFIS can be implemented in several ways to achieve optimal attitude control and improve robustness:

*   **Direct or Hybrid Control:** ANFIS can be used directly to manage the UAV's autopilot systems for optimal attitude control. Alternatively, it can be implemented in a hybrid system, working in conjunction with a traditional PID controller to adapt to varying flight conditions [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285588789_Optimal_attitude_control_of_a_quadrotor_UAV_using_Adaptive_Neuro-Fuzzy_Inference_System_ANFIS, https://www.mi-research.net/en/article/doi/10.1007/s11633-020-1251-2, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270723449_UAV_Controller_Based_on_Adaptive_Neuro-Fuzzy_Inference_System_and_PID].

*   **System Identification and Optimization:** ANFIS can serve as a flight dynamics identifier. In this configuration, it learns the UAV's behavior, and a genetic algorithm (GA) can then be used to optimize the control parameters for the system [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Adaptive-genetic-neuro-fuzzy-attitude-control-for-a-Oliveira-Rosa/5180f14654e3d98aa632a3c9a54da27110c573f6].

*   **Robustness Enhancement:** To improve performance in the presence of external disturbances, ANFIS can be combined with Sliding Mode Control (SMC). This integration enhances the robustness of the quadcopter's trajectory tracking capabilities [https://library.acadlore.com/JISC/2023/2/1/JISC_02.01_04.pdf].

Search Query: application of Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PI-RL) for robust UAV attitude control
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms for UAVs across diverse flight states, research in intelligent flight control systems has focused on reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as a solution to the limitations of traditional PID control [https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04154, https://cs-web.bu.edu/faculty/richwest/papers/tcps2019.pdf, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324492570_Reinforcement_Learning_for_UAV_Attitude_Control].

Studies have investigated several state-of-the-art RL algorithms for attitude control, such as Deep Deterministic Gradient Policy (DDGP), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04154]. This approach allows a DRL controller to learn directly from the UAV's nonlinear dynamics, effectively managing the complex attitude control problem. This method has led to the development of smart flight controllers using neural networks trained with RL for both simulated and real-time applications [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Reinforcement-Learning-for-UAV-Attitude-Control-Koch-Mancuso/b223b7d1dc76be5591bc261e9550ae4d168b6222].

A key benefit is that a DRL controller can generalize well to unseen disturbances like wind and turbulence, and the learning process can be highly efficient, potentially requiring as little as three minutes of flight data [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Reinforcement-Learning-for-UAV-Attitude-Control-Koch-Mancuso/b223b7d1dc76be5591bc261e9550ae4d168b6222].

Search Query: UAV attitude control using Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) principles Extended State Observer (ESO)
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms for UAVs operating in diverse flight states, one approach is Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC), which is applied to attitude tracking control for multirotor UAVs [1, 2, 3].

An ADRC system is composed of three main components [2]:
*   **Tracking Differentiator (TD):** Arranges the transition process.
*   **Extended State Observer (ESO):** Estimates the system states and the "total disturbance," which includes both internal dynamics and external disturbances.
*   **Attitude Feedback Controller (AFC):** A nonlinear state error feedback control law that uses the estimations from the ESO to actively compensate for disturbances.

Some strategies propose variations within this framework, such as using a cascade extended state observer [3]. In testing, ADRC controllers have demonstrated the ability to quickly overcome random disturbances and maintain steady-state accuracy in UAV attitude control [4]. Furthermore, optimized versions of ADRC have been developed for specialized applications, like controlling the attitude of a tethered UAV during fruit picking [5].

Search Query: UAV PID tuning using neural network to model inverse dynamics for gain adaptation
Search Answer: To enhance the performance of PID controllers for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) across diverse flight states, one effective method is to use neural networks for the adaptive tuning of PID gains. This approach allows the controller to perform optimally under various dynamic conditions.

Several strategies involving neural networks have been developed:
*   **Direct Inverse Control (DIC-ANN)**: An artificial neural network can be used for direct inverse control, and its performance can be compared against traditional PID control to demonstrate its effectiveness [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/3823201].
*   **Single-Layer Neural Network Tuning**: A specific implementation can utilize a single-layer neural network, for example, one with 10 hidden neurons, to adjust the PID gains for specific states like the lateral (y) and yaw (ψ) movements of the UAV [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12396714].
*   **Hybrid Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic Control**: A more advanced hybrid strategy combines a neural network PID (NNPID) with a fuzzy logic PID (FPID) into a single controller (NNPID+FPID). This method is designed to overcome the limitations of using either controller individually, leading to more stable and precise trajectory tracking. Within this hybrid system, the components are specialized for different tasks: the NNPID controller excels at managing lateral dynamics and heading control, whereas the FPID controller is more effective for longitudinal, altitude, pitch, and roll dynamics [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0331036].

Search Query: end-to-end UAV attitude control with deep reinforcement learning bypassing PID structure
Search Answer: To address the limitations of traditional cascaded PID control in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which often perform well only under specific flight conditions, researchers are exploring deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as an alternative. DRL can serve as an end-to-end controller, bypassing the conventional PID structure entirely.

Research in this area has shown promising applications:
*   A DRL-based end-to-end control method has been proposed for dynamic UAV target tracking [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9680462/].
*   DRL controllers have been successfully implemented to manage nonlinear attitude control and achieve stabilization in fixed-wing UAVs [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347432613_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_Attitude_Control_of_Fixed-Wing_UAVs].
*   Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are also being investigated for the low-level control of fixed-wing UAVs [https://folk.ntnu.no/torarnj/eeb_ICUAS_Paper.pdf].
*   Further development is focused on creating frameworks to learn these attitude controllers with an emphasis on data efficiency for practical application in real-world UAVs [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04153].

Search Query: PX4 ArduPilot offline PID tuning using flight log data for system identification
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms across diverse flight states and to optimally select PID parameters, a common advanced method is offline tuning based on system identification. This approach uses actual flight data to create an accurate mathematical model of the UAV's flight behavior, which can then be used for more precise tuning. Both ArduPilot and PX4 support this methodology.

### ArduPilot: System Identification Feature
For ArduPilot, there is a "System Identification" feature designed for advanced users to characterize a vehicle's response in the frequency domain.

*   **Process:** This feature works by injecting stimulus signals into the system while in flight and measuring the vehicle's response, which is then recorded in the data flash log. This flight data can be used for mathematical analysis to generate precise models of the vehicle's dynamics.
*   **Implementation:** The implementation of this feature differs depending on the vehicle type. For copters, it is a distinct flight mode. For QuadPlanes, it runs on top of other flight modes (such as qstabilize, qhover, or qloiter) and is activated by an auxiliary switch.
*   **Availability:** It is important to note that this feature is typically not compiled into the stable firmware by default and may require a special build.

### PX4: Offline Tuning with Python Scripts
For PX4, offline PID tuning is commonly accomplished using Python scripts that perform system identification by analyzing flight log data (.ulog files).

*   **Process:** Scripts are available that can process PX4 logs to tune specific control loops. For example, one such script is designed to tune the attitude rate loops based on flight data from a .ulog file [https://github.com/mzahana/px4_pid_tuner].
*   **Log Analysis:** In addition to automated scripts, the PX4 documentation provides comprehensive guides on how to manually analyze flight logs to review the tracking performance of the controllers, which is a crucial step in the tuning process [https://docs.px4.io/main/en/log/flight_review].

Search Query: novel sensor fusion techniques for UAV attitude control state estimation using deep learning
Search Answer: To enhance the actual control performance of PID algorithms for UAVs across diverse flight states, improvements can be made by focusing on the quality of the state information fed into the controller. Novel sensor fusion techniques using deep learning offer a way to achieve more accurate and robust attitude estimation, which is critical for the PID controller's effectiveness.

Several deep learning-based methods for improving sensor fusion in UAV attitude control include:

*   **Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNN):** In this approach, a DLNN is trained for state estimation. The network uses the estimated attitude states as inputs and the real attitude states of the multirotor as the target outputs, effectively learning to correct estimation errors.
*   **Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:** An LSTM network can be employed for attitude estimation by utilizing an incremental learning approach, which allows the model to adapt over time.
*   **Fault-Tolerant Data Fusion:** Deep learning can be used to develop fault-tolerant data fusion systems. These systems are designed to detect and compensate for sensor faults, ensuring the controller receives reliable data even when a sensor is malfunctioning.
*   **Hybrid Fusion Methods:** To improve precision, a hybrid attitude fusion method can be used. This technique incorporates an error model based on the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) output relative to the attitude angles, leading to a more accurate final estimation.

By providing the PID controller with a more precise and reliable measurement of the UAV's attitude, these advanced sensor fusion techniques enhance the overall performance of the control system, making it more robust across various operating conditions. These methods are considered essential for modern UAV navigation and positioning systems.

Search Query: UAV attitude control hybrid "Sliding Mode Control" "Active Disturbance Rejection Control" (SMC-ADRC) architecture and benefits
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) across diverse flight states, a hybrid control architecture can be employed that combines Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) with Sliding Mode Control (SMC) [https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/9/5124, https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/8/7/318, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391456123_Research_on_the_Stability_of_UAV_Attitude_Under_Hybrid_Control_Integrating_Active_Disturbance_Rejection_Control_and_Super-Twisting_Sliding_Mode_Control]. This approach addresses challenges inherent in UAV systems, such as nonlinearity, complex coupling, model uncertainty, and external disturbances from factors like random airflow, in order to achieve stable flight [https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/9/5124, https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/8/7/318].

Specific implementations of this hybrid architecture include:
*   Fusing ADRC with Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control (ST-SMC) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391456123_Research_on_the_Stability_of_UAV_Attitude_Under_Hybrid_Control_Integrating_Active_Disturbance_Rejection_Control_and_Super-Twisting_Sliding_Mode_Control, https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/9/5124].
*   Integrating Linear Active Disturbance Rejection Control (LADRC) with SMC [https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/8/7/318].

In the LADRC-SMC model, a Linear Extended State Observer (LESO) is used to estimate external disturbances and model uncertainties. The LESO provides values for the UAV's attitude angle, angular velocity, and total disturbance [https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/8/7/318].

Simulations have demonstrated that this combined approach offers significant advantages. The ADRC-ST-SMC hybrid algorithm, for example, has been shown to outperform traditional PID and standalone ADRC controllers by providing a better dynamic response, enhanced disturbance rejection performance, and reduced steady-state tracking error [https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/9/5124].

Search Query: Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PI-RL) for UAV attitude control integrating dynamics model into reward function or policy
Search Answer: To enhance the control performance of PID algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude control across diverse flight states, research indicates that reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are modern alternatives that address the limitations of traditional PID controllers.

State-of-the-art RL algorithms, such as Deep Deterministic Gradient Policy (DDGP), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are used to train intelligent flight control systems. Using a DRL approach, a neural network can be trained with a reward function to control the UAV, learning directly from the vehicle's original nonlinear dynamics. This method has been shown to generalize well to unseen disturbances, like wind and turbulence, after being trained on as little as three minutes of flight data. The training can be performed in both simulations and real-time applications.

However, the provided information does not contain specifics on Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PI-RL) or detail the methodology for explicitly integrating a UAV's dynamics model into the reward function or policy.

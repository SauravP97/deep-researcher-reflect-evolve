Search Query: academic analysis of transgender representation in Middle Eastern and North African cinema
Search Answer: Academic analysis of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) cinema includes a growing body of work on queer and transgender representation. This scholarship exists within a broader study of "Queer Arab Cinema," which examines Gay, Lesbian, and Queer (GLQ) identities and illustrates an evolution in film narratives towards acceptance and self-assertion ["https://www.academia.edu/97953843/Queer_Arab_Cinema"]. North African queer cinema, in particular, has gained increasing visibility in recent years ["https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/screen-bodies/2/2/screen020205.xml?print"].

Specific academic dissertations have analyzed the representation and portrayal of transgender individuals across various popular film genres, including comedies, thrillers, and independent dramas ["https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/ETD-TAMU-2012-08-11672/MILLER-DISSERTATION.pdf?sequence=2"]. For example, one thesis examines films from the new cinema of Turkey that feature cis/transgender or non-binary characters, analyzing them through the intersections of liberalism, neoliberal globalism, and LGBTI+ identity politics ["https://www.academia.edu/97953843/Queer_Arab_Cinema"].

The theoretical frameworks for this field are varied. Hamid Naficy’s concept of ‘accented cinema’ is influential in studies of filmmakers in diasporic communities, providing a key lens for analysis ["https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25785273.2023.2231775"]. Furthermore, this research area is situated within the broader context of transnational feminist approaches to film and media from the MENA region ["https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25785273.2023.2231775"].

Search Query: legal and social status of transgender people in Middle East and North Africa
Search Answer: Transgender individuals in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region face systemic and endemic discrimination and violence from both state and community sources [https://worldwithoutgenocide.org/genocides-and-conflicts/background/treatment-of-transgender-individuals-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa]. As a stigmatized population, many cannot be public about their identity [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11496897].

A critical issue is the lack of clear legal pathways for transgender people to obtain legal gender recognition in many countries, including Egypt, Lebanon, and Tunisia. This absence of legal frameworks increases their vulnerability to abuse, such as arbitrary arrests by security forces, and leads to systemic discrimination in housing, employment, and healthcare [https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/04/08/tough-territory-transgender-people-middle-east-and-north-africa]. In Egypt, for example, the judicial system's pathologization of transgender identities means that individuals seeking legal gender recognition may be forced to endure humiliating medical examinations due to the lack of proper legislative or procedural frameworks [https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/04/08/tough-territory-transgender-people-middle-east-and-north-africa].

To fully understand the situation, one must consider social norms and cultural practices in addition to formal laws. A report on Iraq, for instance, found that even where legal protections for LGBTQ rights may exist, there is often no feasible legal recourse for victims of hate crimes based on sexual orientation or gender identity [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_rights_in_the_Middle_East]. In response to this systemic oppression and persecution, non-governmental organizations like Rainbow Street have been formed to provide support to LGBTQ people in the region [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_rights_in_the_Middle_East].

Search Query: application of trans theory (gender performativity, cisnormativity) and film theory (cinematic gaze, postcolonial) to queer Middle Eastern cinema
Search Answer: Scholars apply a combination of trans, film, and postcolonial theories to analyze how queer Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) cinema navigates and challenges cisnormativity, heteronormativity, and colonial legacies. These intersecting theoretical frameworks are essential for understanding the unique aesthetics, political stances, and representational strategies of these films.

### Application of Trans Theory

Trans theory offers critical tools for deconstructing how gender is portrayed and understood in MENA cinema, moving beyond essentialist views to focus on performance, social construction, and the critique of normative identities.

*   **Gender Performativity**: Judith Butler's theory that gender is not an innate quality but is constructed through stylized, repeated acts is frequently applied to MENA cinema [5, 8]. This framework allows for an analysis of how characters perform or subvert culturally specific gender norms [8]. For example, an analysis of Iranian artist Shadi Ghadirian’s photography series *Qajar* uses Butler's concepts to show how the images deconstruct and parody traditional gender roles through performance [5]. Similarly, queer characters in Arab cinema are often examined for how they perform their identities in ways that disrupt and challenge heteronormative expectations [2, 4, 8, 10].

*   **Cisnormativity and Queer Unfixity**: Film analyses often critique cisnormativity—the assumption that all individuals are cisgender—and how it is reinforced by "heteronormative and cisnormative patriarchal nation-states" [2]. Scholarship on contemporary Middle Eastern cinema highlights how these films often present a "queer unfixity," deconstructing stable identity categories. This approach challenges cis-heteronormativity from a non-Western perspective, disrupting the idea that a cisgender identity is the unquestioned default [2].

*   **Decolonizing Theory**: A significant focus within the scholarship is the need to decolonize Western-centric queer and trans theory. Scholars argue against applying universalist models, such as the "coming out" narrative, to MENA contexts where they may not be culturally relevant [4, 6, 8]. Instead, they advocate for understanding gender and sexuality through local frameworks, including Islamic traditions, kinship structures, and pre-colonial histories of gender variance [8, 10]. This approach critiques the ways Western queer theory can impose its own norms and calls for a more nuanced engagement with diverse, local experiences [8].

### Application of Film and Postcolonial Theory

Film and postcolonial theories are often intertwined to analyze how cinematic techniques and narrative structures engage with histories of colonialism, Orientalism, and contemporary geopolitical power dynamics.

*   **The Cinematic Gaze**: The concept of the cinematic gaze is central to analyzing power dynamics in film. Laura Mulvey's theory of the "male gaze," which describes how cinema often frames women from a masculine, heterosexual perspective, is frequently extended to a "colonial gaze" or "imperial gaze" [3, 7]. This gaze frames queer subjects in MENA films through a Western lens, often portraying them as needing rescue from their supposedly oppressive cultures and reinforcing a binary between a 'liberal' West and a 'repressive' East [3, 7]. This imperial gaze is often seen as intertwined with the "heteronormative gaze" [0].

    In response, filmmakers work to create a "counter-hegemonic gaze" [6]. The documentary *My Queer Life*, for instance, is analyzed for its ability to challenge Orientalist and heteronormative perspectives [6]. Other films develop a "queer gaze" that is not about possession or objectification but about mutual recognition [7]. In the Moroccan film *The Blue Caftan*, director Maryam Touzani subverts the traditional male gaze by using tactile close-ups and focusing on subtle gestures to convey unspoken love and desire between two men, portraying their inner worlds with intimacy and without moralizing [3, 4].

*   **Postcolonial Theory and Representation**: Postcolonial theory is crucial for critiquing the "othering" of queer Middle Eastern subjects by both Western and local patriarchal powers [0]. It is used to deconstruct representations that pit a supposedly advanced West against a repressive East, particularly in relation to "homonationalist" and "pinkwashing" agendas, where queer rights are selectively used to justify nationalist or imperialist positions [1, 2, 3, 6].

    Filmmakers in the region must often navigate the "burden of representation," challenging the pervasive stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in Western media [4, 7]. Their work is analyzed for its resistance to both local censorship and the expectations of Western film festival audiences [4]. Some filmmakers, like the Armenian-Soviet director Sergei Parajanov, have been analyzed through a postcolonial lens for using a "poetics of ambiguity." This strategy creates queer expressions of desire that subvert both heteronormative standards and the repressive cultural narratives of state power, requiring a decolonized approach to queer theory to be fully understood [0, 4, 9]. By forging a distinct cinematic language, these films resist simplistic binaries and highlight complex, localized queer experiences [5, 6].

Search Query: list of Middle Eastern and North African films featuring transgender characters or narratives
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, a comprehensive list of Middle Eastern and North African films with transgender themes is not available, which precludes an in-depth analysis of specific films. However, the materials indicate a significant and growing academic and cultural interest in this area.

This burgeoning scholarly focus is evidenced by active calls for papers for publications such as *The Handbook of Trans Cinema*, which specifically seeks chapters on films with transgender themes from the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. Another call for papers is dedicated entirely to "Middle Eastern and North African Films with Transgender Themes" [https://networks.h-net.org/group/discussions/20055599/cfp-chapters-trans-cinema-middle-east-africa-and-south-asia, https://callforpaper.org/cfp/middle-eastern-films-with-trans-themes-2025-middle-eastern-and-north-african-films-with-transgender-themes_4113].

Cultural interest is also on the rise, with film festivals beginning to showcase queer cinema from the region. For example, a festival organized in collaboration with ShakoMako, a cultural platform for the MENA diaspora, has screened films exploring queer experiences. These narratives touch upon related themes such as cross-dressing, cultural performance, and religious oppression [https://www.milleworld.com/arab-films-queer-habibi-collective/].

This increased attention in the MENA region reflects a broader global trend. The 2010s saw a significant rise in films featuring transgender characters, which coincided with greater public focus on and visibility of transgender issues [https://grokipedia.com/page/List_of_feature_films_with_transgender_characters].

Search Answer: Based on the provided information, a comprehensive paper on Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) films with transgender themes cannot be fully constructed. The available sources focus on a single, significant queer film and do not contain specific analyses of transgender representation or information on other requested titles. However, an in-depth discussion of this film offers a valuable starting point for understanding LGBTQ+ narratives in the region's cinema.

### Queer Kinship and Localized Identity in MENA Cinema: An Analysis of "The Blue Caftan"

Representations of non-normative sexualities and gender identities in Middle Eastern and North African cinema are gradually emerging, offering nuanced challenges to both local and global narratives. While a broad survey is beyond the scope of the provided data, a focused analysis of Maryam Touzani's "The Blue Caftan" reveals key thematic and theoretical considerations within contemporary queer filmmaking from the region. The film serves as a powerful case study in its depiction of love, homophobia, and the construction of kinship outside of heteronormative structures.

"The Blue Caftan" is widely described as a groundbreaking queer, Arabic-language drama from Morocco that has made a significant impact on LGBTQ and MENA cinema [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The film explores themes of queer yearning and unconditional love against the backdrop of societal homophobia [1, 3, 4]. It centers on the relationship between a closeted gay tailor, his loving wife who is aware of his sexuality, and his young male apprentice.

A notable aspect of the film, highlighted by scholarly analysis, is its rejection of the common narrative that migration is a prerequisite for queer acceptance and self-realization [2]. Instead of positioning the West as a sanctuary, Touzani's film insists on exploring the possibilities of queer life within a local Moroccan context. This approach localizes the characters' experiences and desires, resisting a universalizing or Western-centric view of LGBTQ identity.

To analyze the film's depiction of queer relationships, the concept of "transfiliation" has been applied [2]. This theoretical term helps articulate the formation of non-biological, chosen family structures, or queer kinship. In "The Blue Caftan," the bond that forms between the husband, his wife, and his apprentice creates a unique familial unit built on love and acceptance, challenging traditional notions of family. This portrayal of queer kinship offers a model of resilience and love that is deeply embedded in its specific cultural and social setting.

In conclusion, while "The Blue Caftan" is a vital contribution to queer cinema, the provided sources do not specifically analyze it through the lens of transgender representation. The film's focus is on homosexual desire and the complexities of queer relationships within a heteronormative society. Furthermore, no information was found for other films, such as "My Queer Life," to broaden this analysis. Therefore, while Touzani's film offers a profound look at localized queer identity and kinship in MENA cinema, a more extensive study is required to specifically address transgender themes in the region's filmography.

Search Query: censorship and industrial challenges for producing LGBTQ+ films in MENA region
Search Answer: Filmmakers exploring LGBTQ+ themes in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region face significant industrial challenges, primarily stemming from government censorship [https://www.reuters.com/article/business/feature-arab-film-directors-tackle-gender-taboos-on-big-screen-idUSL8N2UI3XH/, https://bwog.com/2019/10/arab-queer-cinema-panelists-talk-breaking-the-law-filmmaking-and-appropriation/]. In order to be shown, films require approval from state bodies, and those with LGBTQ+ themes often fail to get past censors. This is particularly true in the Gulf, where homosexuality is illegal [https://deadline.com/2022/05/everything-everywhere-all-once-banned-middle-east-1235016780/].

There have been several recent, high-profile examples of such censorship. In June 2022, the United Arab Emirates' Media Regulatory Office banned the animated movie *Lightyear* because of a kiss between a lesbian couple, citing it as a “violation of the country’s media content standards” [https://www.skeyesmedia.org/en/News/Reports/08-08-2022/10183]. Similarly, in April 2022, both Kuwait and Jordan banned a different film after a character's sexual orientation was deemed “immoral” and contrary to “local culture.” Jordan's Media Commission (JMC) issued its ban after Disney refused a request to cut scenes that made reference to a same-sex orientation [https://www.skeyesmedia.org/en/News/Reports/08-08-2022/10183]. These challenges are a key topic of discussion among queer Arab filmmakers seeking to navigate the industry [https://bwog.com/2019/10/arab-queer-cinema-panelists-talk-breaking-the-law-filmmaking-and-appropriation/].

Information on its critical reception is limited, though according to one user-based rating site, it was the #975 best film of 1984 [https://rateyourmusic.com/film/sabaniye/].

Search Query: academic analysis of cross-dressing and non-normative gender identity in the 1984 Turkish film "Şabaniye"
Search Answer: The 1984 Turkish musical comedy *Şabaniye* serves as an example of a film from the region exploring non-normative gender identity and has been the subject of academic analysis for its queer themes [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eabaniye, https://www.academia.edu/97960990/Post_Coup_Queerness_in_Turkish_Cinema_Gender_Sexuality_and_Psychomachia_in_Kartal_Tibets_%C5%9Eabaniye]. Categorized as a film featuring "Cross-dressing in film," *Şabaniye* is examined for its "queer gender dynamics and sexual politics," particularly within the socio-political context of the societal "psychomachia" in Turkey following the 1980 coup [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eabaniye, https://www.academia.edu/97960990/Post_Coup_Queerness_in_Turkish_Cinema_Gender_Sexuality_and_Psychomachia_in_Kartal_Tibets_%C5%9Eabaniye].

This academic inquiry situates the film as part of the new cinema of Turkey, which presents "'openly' non-normative sexualities through cis/transgender male, female, or non-binary characters" [https://www.academia.edu/97960990/Post_Coup_Queerness_in_Turkish_Cinema_Gender_Sexuality_and_Psychomachia_in_Kartal_Tibets_%C5%9Eabaniye]. The analysis of the film's narrative and form is also used to explore how the nation-state creates unstable values to manage queer subjectivity. More broadly, research connects films like *Şabaniye* to the intersection of liberalism, neoliberal globalism, and the emergence of LGBTI+ identity politics in Turkey [https://www.academia.edu/97960990/Post_Coup_Queerness_in_Turkish_Cinema_Gender_Sexuality_and_Psychomachia_in_Kartal_Tibets_%C5%9Eabaniye].

Search Query: scholarly analysis of other Turkish films with cross-dressing or queer gender performance from the post-1980 coup era besides Şabaniye
Search Answer: In Turkish cinema, a second wave of films featuring cross-dressing performances emerged during the 1980s, following a previous phase in the 1960s. This post-1980 military coup era of filmmaking has been a subject of scholarly analysis, which examines the intersection of politics, gender, and national trauma [https://dokumen.pub/cross-dressing-in-turkish-cinema-politics-gender-and-national-trauma-9780755634224-9780755634255-9780755634231.html, https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/70421/1/corrections_6.draft_.pdf].

Academic research offers broad histories of LGBT representation in Turkish cinema over the last fifty years, as well as more focused studies on the "new cinema of Turkey" that feature "openly" non-normative sexualities through cis/transgender characters [https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA490983373&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=15474348&p=AONE&sw=w, https://www.academia.edu/97960990/Post_Coup_Queerness_in_Turkish_Cinema_Gender_Sexuality_and_Psychomachia_in_Kartal_Tibets_Şabaniye]. Some work also applies queer theory to traditional Turkish performance art to discuss gender [https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9780755634231_A41598192/preview-9780755634231_A41598192.pdf].

From this period, the film *Şabaniye* is highlighted as an epitome of the queer gender dynamics present in post-coup Turkish cinema [https://www.academia.edu/97960990/Post_Coup_Queerness_in_Turkish_Cinema_Gender_Sexuality_and_Psychomachia_in_Kartal_Tibets_Şabaniye]. However, despite the scholarly consensus on this wave of cross-dressing films, the provided sources do not name other specific Turkish films from the post-1980 coup era with similar themes.

Search Query: academic analysis of films from "New Cinema of Turkey" with cross-dressing or non-normative gender performance
Search Answer: Academic analysis of the "New Cinema of Turkey" provides a lens through which to examine films featuring non-normative sexualities and gender expressions, including portrayals of cisgender, transgender, and non-binary characters [https://network.bepress.com/explore/social-and-behavioral-sciences/sociology/?q=social+problems&facet=subject_facet%3A%22Neoliberalism%22&facet=institution_title%3A%22City+University+of+New+York+%28CUNY%29%22, https://network.bepress.com/explore/arts-and-humanities/television/?facet=publication_facet%3A%22Dissertations%2C+Theses%2C+and+Capstone+Projects%22, https://www.academia.edu/97960990/Post_Coup_Queerness_in_Turkish_Cinema_Gender_Sexuality_and_Psychomachia_in_Kartal_Tibets_Şabaniye, https://www.academia.edu/27805853/Changing_LGBT_Narratives_in_Turkish_Cinema]. Scholars in this area explore the intersection of liberalism, global neoliberalism, and LGBTI+ identity politics and visibility in Turkish media [https://www.academia.edu/97960990/Post_Coup_Queerness_in_Turkish_Cinema_Gender_Sexuality_and_Psychomachia_in_Kartal_Tibets_Şabaniye, https://www.academia.edu/27805853/Changing_LGBT_Narratives_in_Turkish_Cinema].

One argument posits that while LGBTI+ visibility has increased, recent film representations are often shaped by "acceptance and respectability politics" that align with the ideals of global neoliberalism. This contrasts with earlier films, which were seen as more challenging to the status quo and established gender norms [https://www.academia.edu/27805853/Changing_LGBT_Narratives_in_Turkish_Cinema]. Research into the history of LGBT representation in Turkish cinema over the last fifty years has noted a progression in the focus of these depictions, moving from lesbian to transsexual and, most recently, to gay male characters [https://www.academia.edu/27805853/Changing_LGBT_Narratives_in_Turkish_Cinema].

An example of a film that receives critical attention is Kartal Tibet's *Şabaniye*. One analysis examines the film's "queer gender dynamics and sexual politics" specifically within the context of Turkey's societal psychomachia following the 1980 coup, highlighting how the film engages with gender and sexuality during a period of significant political and social upheaval [https://www.academia.edu/97960990/Post_Coup_Queerness_in_Turkish_Cinema_Gender_Sexuality_and_Psychomachia_in_Kartal_Tibets_Şabaniye].

Search Query: list of Turkish comedy films from the 1980s featuring male-to-female cross-dressing
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, there are no search results that contain a list of Turkish comedy films from the 1980s featuring male-to-female cross-dressing. One source that discusses a new trend of satiric comedies in 1980s Turkish cinema, which aimed to criticize social transformation and new right policies, does not mention cross-dressing as a theme [https://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12607594/index.pdf].

However, the search results do mention other Turkish films with related themes. The 1980 film “Beddua” (Damning) starred the famous singer Bülent Ersoy and was the first in Turkish cinema to feature the life story of a transsexual person, though it is not identified as a comedy. An even earlier example of cross-dressing in Turkish film is the 1923 movie “Leblebici Horhor,” in which a male character cross-dresses to save his girlfriend [https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/portrayal-of-transgenders-in-turkish-films-or-lack-thereof-24492].

Search Query: Kemal Sunal 1980s filmography plot summaries involving disguise or female impersonation
Search Answer: In Turkish cinema, the trope of a male character disguising himself as a woman has been used for comedic effect and as a plot device. For instance, in the film *Şabaniye*, the character Şaban, played by actor Kemal Sunal, impersonates a woman in order to escape a blood feud. In another film, *Belalı Torun*, Sunal's character again disguises himself as a woman, this time to flee from the mob [https://digitalarchive.library.bogazici.edu.tr/bitstreams/20d1685f-78d0-48ac-a6ed-cc6b354e6e83/download].

Search Query: scholarly analysis OR critical reception of the 1980 Turkish film "Beddua" starring Bülent Ersoy
Search Answer: The 1980 Turkish film "Beddua," starring Bülent Ersoy in her first major role, has been described in a scholarly analysis as a "nearly forgotten queer gem of Turkish cinema" ["https://www.academia.edu/6490032/Coup_de_Genre_The_Trials_and_Tribulations_of_B%C3%BClent_Ersoy"]. However, a 2014 critical analysis by B. Ertür critiques the film's "specious internal logic," which suggests that the main character's indifference towards women is the result of a sexual assault he experienced as a child at the hands of a male villager ["https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/34209/1/Ertur%20Lebow%20Coup%20de%20Genre.pdf"].

Search Query: biography of Turkish singer Bülent Ersoy gender transition 1980 military coup performance ban
Search Answer: Bülent Ersoy, a prominent Turkish singer and transgender woman, underwent a male-to-female transition that coincided with the 1980 military coup led by Kenan Evren [1, 3, https://www.academia.edu/6490032/Coup_de_Genre_The_Trials_and_Tribulations_of_B%C3%BClent_Ersoy]. The military regime initiated a crackdown on what it considered "social deviance" [1, 3, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BClent_Ersoy]. As a result, Ersoy's public performances were banned, along with those of other transgender artists, and the government also shut down transgender brothels [1, 3, 4, 5, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BClent_Ersoy, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bulent-ersoy-remarkable-story_b_2330277].

In 1981, following a prison term, Ersoy had gender reassignment surgery in London [1, 2, https://www.dailysabah.com/arts/portrait/bulent-ersoy-turkeys-transgender-diva]. The generals who orchestrated the coup disapproved of her, and the ban on her stage appearances was enforced throughout the 1980s [5, https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna25247017].

Search Query: production history and contemporary critical reception of the 1980 Turkish film "Beddua" in the context of the 1980 military coup
Search Answer: The 1980 Turkish film *Beddua* (The Curse), starring the prominent singer and actress Bülent Ersoy, is a significant work in the context of transgender representation in Middle Eastern cinema. There is conflicting information regarding the film's director, credited as either Melih Gülgen or Osman F. Seden. Produced and released just before the military coup of September 12, 1980, *Beddua* was one of a series of popular melodramas Ersoy made in the late 1970s and early 1980s, an era that coincided with her own gender affirmation.

The film's plot is characteristic of the popular "arabesk" revenge melodrama genre. It centers on a singer, Bülent, who is wronged by a man. After a tragic love affair that leads to his lover’s suicide and his own blinding, the character ultimately undergoes sex reassignment surgery and uses her subsequent wealth and power to exact revenge.

Contemporary reception for *Beddua* was very positive; it was an "extremely popular" and significant box office success, becoming one of the highest-grossing productions of the year. The film's success was closely tied to the public's fascination with Ersoy's own life. While the film was released after her gender affirmation surgery, her transition was still a subject of widespread public rumor and not yet officially public knowledge, and the film’s narrative directly engaged with this public intrigue.

The film's cultural significance is profoundly shaped by its timing. Shortly after its successful run, the military junta that seized power in the September 1980 coup initiated a widespread crackdown on perceived "social deviance" and "degeneration," with a preoccupation on enforcing traditional gender and sexual norms. In 1981, as part of this repressive campaign, Bülent Ersoy was banned from all public performances due to her gender identity. This prohibition, enforced by the Ankara Martial Law Command, specifically included all her stage and screen appearances, and the screening of her films was forbidden.

The ban lasted for eight years, forcing Ersoy to continue her career in exile in Germany. It was not lifted until 1988, following a change in the Turkish Civil Code that allowed for legal gender change. Thus, *Beddua* stands as a poignant cultural artifact from the brief period just before the military regime enacted its official and repressive stance against transgender identity. Its popular success, fueled by the public's interest in its star's trans identity, stands in stark contrast to the state-enforced censorship that immediately followed its release.

Search Query: comparative analysis of transgender narrative in "Beddua" (1980) and queer performance in "Şabaniye" (1984) in post-1980 coup Turkish cinema
Search Answer: In the landscape of Middle Eastern cinema, Turkish film provides a particularly potent case study for the representation of transgender themes, especially when viewed through the lens of the country's turbulent political history. A comparative analysis of two films, *Beddua* (The Curse, 1980) and *Şabaniye* (1984), reveals a significant shift in how gender non-conformity was depicted before and after the 1980 military coup, a period of intense social and political repression [0, 1, 5]. The coup ushered in an era of oppression that targeted not only political dissent but also perceived "social deviance," leading to a ban on transgender individuals, including the famed singer Bülent Ersoy, from public life and the stage [0]. This paradoxical atmosphere, both repressive and transformative, forced filmmakers to adopt different strategies for representing queer and trans identities [5].

Released just before the coup, *Beddua* is a melodramatic musical that presents a direct transgender narrative [0, 1]. The film stars Bülent Ersoy, a prominent transgender singer, and chronicles her character's journey from a male-bodied singer to a celebrated trans woman diva [0, 1]. Framed within the genre of melodrama, the film focuses on a suffering, tragic protagonist who eventually triumphs, a common trope in Turkish Yeşilçam cinema [0, 3, 5]. It is considered a sincere depiction of a transgender story, analyzed through the theories of transgender performance and melodrama [1, 2, 3]. *Beddua* thus represents a pre-coup moment where a celebrity’s trans identity could be the subject of a direct and serious, albeit melodramatic, narrative [0].

In stark contrast, *Şabaniye*, released in 1984 during the peak of post-coup repression, embeds its queer themes within the seemingly apolitical and popular genre of comedy [0, 1]. The film stars beloved comedian Kemal Sunal, whose character cross-dresses and adopts the persona of a female singer named Şabaniye [0]. Rather than a direct "transgender narrative," the film utilizes what can be analyzed as "queer performance" through the theoretical lenses of camp and drag [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]. This comedic framework provided a safer, more permissible space for audiences to engage with gender non-conformity at a time when direct depictions were forbidden [0]. The film's immense popularity demonstrates how drag performance became a strategic avenue for queer representation, allowing it to circulate successfully in an environment hostile to overt expressions of gender variance [0, 1].

The comparison between *Beddua* and *Şabaniye* highlights a representational split forced by the repressive political climate—a shift from a tragic, melodramatic narrative to a comedic, queer performance [1, 5]. However, analysis suggests that both films ultimately exhibit an "ideological ambivalence" [1, 2, 3]. According to a 2012 Master's thesis by Halil Kutlukhan Kutlu, which examines these films in the repressive, heteronormative, and binary-gendered social climate of the era, both films are simultaneously "subversive and normative" [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. While they succeeded in bringing transgender identities and queer performance to mainstream Turkish cinema, their narrative structures ultimately reinforced the gender binary and heteronormativity, showcasing the complex and often contradictory nature of queer representation under oppressive regimes [1, 2, 3].

Search Query: Notion database core features guide: views, property types, filtering, sorting, and grouping
Search Answer: Notion's databases are a powerful feature for data organization, centered around key components like views, filters, sorting, and grouping. They also support various property types and advanced features such as relations, rollups, and formulas. Users can manage these components through a settings menu, often located in the top right corner of the database.

Here is a breakdown of Notion's core database functionalities:

*   **Views**: You can create multiple views for a single database, allowing you to see the same data in different layouts. Each view can have its own unique settings, and you can customize how database pages open within each view.
*   **Filtering**: To display only the data that meets specific criteria, you can apply filters based on its properties. For more complex needs, advanced filters can be created using filter groups that combine `AND` and `OR` logic.
*   **Sorting**: Data can be rearranged and organized using the `Sort` option. If multiple sorting conditions are applied, the first condition takes precedence, and subsequent conditions are used to sort the items within the already sorted groups.
*   **Grouping**: This feature organizes data into sections based on a specific property. Grouping takes priority over sorting; items are first organized into groups, and then the sorting order is applied to the items within each of those groups.

Both filter and sort settings can be saved for a specific database view, ensuring that the custom configuration applies to everyone using that view.

Search Query: Obsidian plugins for Notion-like database functionality including Table, Kanban, and Calendar views
Search Answer: Several Obsidian plugins can effectively replicate Notion's multi-view database functionality, allowing users to manage tasks like content creation within Obsidian. The key plugins for this purpose are Obsidian Projects, DataLoom, the Database Folder plugin, and the obsidian-database-plugin.

Here is a detailed comparison of these options:

### 1. Obsidian Projects
This community plugin is frequently cited as a primary and powerful option that aims to duplicate the functionality of a Notion database, an Airtable database, and a Google Sheet from within Obsidian.

*   **Strengths**: It is a comprehensive tool designed specifically to mirror Notion's database power. Its versatility is demonstrated by its use in creating tools like a content calendar, which directly addresses the need for a calendar view.

### 2. DataLoom

The `Person`, `Checkbox`, and `Formula` property types were not described in the source materials.

Search Query: Obsidian Dataview plugin tutorial explaining DQL query language, data sources like frontmatter and inline fields, and how to create dynamic tables and lists
Search Answer: The Obsidian Dataview plugin can help replicate some of Notion's database functionality by allowing you to query metadata from your notes and display it in various formats. It operates on the core principles of data indexing and data querying.

**Data Indexing**
Dataview begins by indexing information from your notes. This includes data such as tags, list items, and custom metadata fields that you add to your notes either in the frontmatter or as inline fields. Only the information that has been indexed by the plugin is available to be queried.

**Data Querying with DQL**
Once the data is indexed, you can query it using the Dataview Query Language (DQL), which is a powerful, SQL-like language at the core of the plugin's functionality. To use it, you place DQL queries within a `dataview` code block inside a note. These queries can be used to list, filter, sort, or group your data. The results are dynamic and automatically update whenever the underlying note data changes.

DQL supports four different query types to produce various outputs, allowing you to create dynamic tables and lists from your note data. For example, you could use it to generate a list of all notes that mention a specific person or to build a video database.

Search Query: in-depth tutorial of Obsidian Projects plugin covering setup, data sourcing from notes and folders, and creating Table, Kanban, Calendar, and List views
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, the **Obsidian Projects** plugin is the most effective tool for replicating Notion's multi-view database functionality within Obsidian. It allows you to manage note-based projects by extracting structured data from your notes and presenting it in various formats.

### Setup and Data Sourcing

To use the plugin, you must first install it within Obsidian. A "project" is created by sourcing notes from a specific folder or by grouping notes that share a common tag. The plugin then gathers the structured data (from YAML frontmatter or inline fields) from these notes into a unified, table-like format where each note represents a row. You can also utilize note templates when creating new notes directly within a project view, ensuring consistency across your data.

### Available Views

The Obsidian Projects plugin includes four built-in views that replicate much of Notion's database functionality:

*   **Table View:** This view presents your notes and their associated data in a standard table format, similar to a spreadsheet.
*   **Board (Kanban) View:** This view functions as a Kanban board, allowing you to organize notes into columns based on a specific property (e.g., status). It is worth noting that a separate, dedicated Kanban plugin also exists for Obsidian.
*   **Calendar View:** Any note containing a date property can be displayed as an event on a calendar. The view is interactive, allowing you to add new notes for a specific day by double-clicking or right-clicking on that date in the calendar.
*   **List View:** While the plugin does not have a view explicitly named "List View," its core functionality of collecting notes and displaying them in a table-like structure effectively serves as a list.

Additionally, the plugin offers a **Gallery View**, which displays notes as cards, similar to Notion's gallery view.

*   **Dataview** and the **Kanban plugin** are excellent alternatives if you only need a specific view (like a Kanban board) and prefer a more focused, potentially simpler tool for that task.

Search Query: obsidian-database-plugin tutorial creating embeddable editable database blocks in notes
Search Answer: Obsidian's core plugin, **Bases**, can effectively replicate much of Notion's multi-view database functionality. It allows you to create embeddable and editable database-like views directly from the properties within your local Markdown notes.

### Core Functionality of Bases

Bases uses the properties (YAML frontmatter) in your notes to generate dynamic views that can be sorted, filtered, and edited. This allows you to manage your notes in a structured way without needing to learn complex query languages required by some other plugins. It is presented as an accessible alternative for users transitioning from Notion.

There are two primary ways to display a base within a note:
1.  **Embed a base file**: You can create a dedicated `.base` file and then embed it into any note using the `!` syntax.
2.  **Embed as a code block**: You can create a base directly inside a note by using a `base` code block and the Bases syntax.

A key feature is the ability to edit note properties directly from within the embedded view, which simplifies making batch edits across multiple files.

### Supported Views (Replicating Notion)

Based on the available information, Bases supports the following layouts:
*   **Table View**: Yes
*   **List View**: Yes
*   **Kanban View**: Yes, via a "Cards" layout that functions similarly to a Kanban board.
*   **Calendar View**: This view is not mentioned as a currently supported layout. However, it is noted that community plugins may add more layouts to Bases in the future.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**
*   **No-Code Solution**: It is designed to be user-friendly and does not require coding, making it more accessible than plugins like Dataview.
*   **Core Plugin**: As a core plugin, it is officially supported and integrated into Obsidian.
*   **Direct Editing**: You can edit note properties directly from the database view, which is efficient for managing metadata.
*   **Live and Embeddable**: The views are live and can be embedded anywhere in your vault.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Limited Views**: Based on the provided information, it natively replicates Table, List, and Kanban views but lacks a built-in Calendar view.

### Enhancing the Experience with Another Plugin

For a more seamless editing experience with the *content* of your notes (not just the properties), the community plugin **Sync Embeds** is a useful companion. It is designed to make embedded notes feel like a live, integrated part of the note you are currently viewing, allowing for in-place editing of the note's content.

Search Query: Obsidian Database Folder plugin create calendar view
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, several Obsidian plugins can effectively replicate the **calendar view** component of Notion's database functionality.

Here are the key plugins and methods for creating calendar views in Obsidian, with a comparison of their features:

### Core Calendar Plugins

*   **Full Calendar**: This plugin integrates the FullCalendar library directly into Obsidian, allowing you to manage schedules and events within your vault. Its primary strength is its ability to source events dynamically from your notes, either by pulling data from frontmatter (YAML) or from dedicated event lists within your daily notes.

*   **Obsidian Big Calendar**: This plugin is noted for its clear display of multiple events across various timeframes. It offers day, week, month, and agenda formats, making it a strong choice for users who need to visualize a busy schedule.

*   **Bases**: While not exclusively a calendar plugin, Bases can create a calendar view by filtering notes from specified folders. This method is particularly useful for creating specialized calendars, such as a content calendar that pulls from folders containing articles or emails.

### Specialized and Alternative Calendar Views

*   **Every-day-calendar**: For a higher-level perspective, this plugin provides a "year at a glance" view, which can be useful for long-term planning and tracking.

### General Calendar Capabilities in the Obsidian Ecosystem

The Obsidian community plugin directory lists numerous other tools with calendar-related functions. These plugins extend functionality by:
*   Rendering a calendar from event information found within notes.
*   Integrating with iCalendar URLs for syncing with external calendars.
*   Using YAML keys with dates to display notes in a calendar format.
*   Working in conjunction with other popular plugins like **Daily Notes**, **Periodic Notes**, **Tasks**, and **Dataview** to create powerful, interconnected systems.

Search Query: Obsidian workflow integrating Database Folder with Full Calendar plugin for unified multi-view database
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, there is no described workflow for integrating the Database Folder plugin with the Full Calendar plugin to create a unified, multi-view database system.

However, the information does provide details on how some of these plugins function and integrate with others:

*   **Full Calendar Plugin:** This plugin operates by pulling event data directly from the frontmatter of individual notes or from event lists within your daily notes. It has established integrations with other Obsidian plugins, including Dataview and Tasks.
*   **Kanban and Full Calendar Integration:** A specific integration exists between the Obsidian Kanban plugin and the Full Calendar plugin. This allows users to copy a card from a Kanban board directly to their calendar.

While a single plugin that seamlessly replicates all of Notion's database views is not detailed, one source speculates that a future, more comprehensive "Notion-like" database plugin might eventually replace the need for separate tools like Kanban and Full Calendar.

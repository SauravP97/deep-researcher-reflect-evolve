Search Query: challenges and objectives of cislunar Space Situational Awareness (SSA) compared to LEO and GEO
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in cislunar space and support short-term tracking and monitoring, one must address the unique challenges of the region by focusing on specific objectives. Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is the practice of tracking, characterizing, and predicting the future position of objects in space [https://www.ansys.com/simulation-topics/what-is-space-situational-awareness]. The challenges and objectives for SSA in the cislunar region—the area between geosynchronous orbit (GEO) and the Moon's gravitational boundary—differ significantly from those in the more familiar Low Earth Orbit (LEO) [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576524003308, https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/162417/rude-rudc6118-sm-tpp-2025-thesis.pdf.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y].

While LEO is a densely populated and contested region where the primary objective is mitigating collision risks, the cislunar region presents a different set of difficulties related to its vast volume and complex gravitational dynamics [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576524003308, https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/162417/rude-rudc6118-sm-tpp-2025-thesis.pdf.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y].

### Key Challenges in Cislunar SSA

To achieve effective SSA, the following challenges must be overcome:
*   **Novel Orbit Determination**: The unique and complex gravitational environment of cislunar space necessitates the development of novel orbit determination methods, as techniques used for LEO and GEO may not be sufficient [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576524003308].
*   **Continuous Detection**: A significant challenge is designing an architecture capable of continuously detecting low-thrust spacecraft throughout the vastness of the cislunar region [https://hanspeterschaub.info/Papers/grads/MichaelKlonowski.pdf].
*   **Technological and Organizational Hurdles**: Cislunar SSA faces significant systemic issues. Key areas requiring improvement include infrastructure, communication structures, acquisition strategies, and policy-driven timelines [https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/162417/rude-rudc6118-sm-tpp-2025-thesis.pdf.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y].

### Objectives for Effective Cislunar SSA

The design of a cislunar SSA architecture should be guided by the following objectives to support tracking and monitoring tasks:
*   **Maximize Coverage and Minimize Cost**: A primary goal is to design a system that maximizes coverage of trajectories and volumes of space while minimizing the total cost, which is influenced by the number and capabilities of the observers [https://hanspeterschaub.info/Papers/grads/MichaelKlonowski.pdf].
*   **Ensure Continuous Detection**: An essential objective is to create a framework that ensures the continuous detection and tracking of all spacecraft, particularly those using low-thrust propulsion, throughout the region [https://hanspeterschaub.info/Papers/grads/MichaelKlonowski.pdf].

Search Query: definition of cislunar space and the strategic importance of Earth-Moon Lagrange points L1-L5 for trajectory planning and space domain awareness
Search Answer: To conduct situational awareness of space targets in cislunar space and support tracking and monitoring tasks, a key strategy involves leveraging the unique gravitational characteristics of this region [https://cdcl.umd.edu/papers/icssa20.pdf].

Cislunar space is the area of deep space influenced by the combined gravitational pull of the Earth-Moon system, encompassing the vast region between terrestrial orbits and the Moon [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120009459, https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/cislunar-space/]. Within this environment are five Lagrange points (L1-L5), which are equilibrium points where the gravitational forces from the Earth and the Moon on an object balance each other out [https://www.afrl.af.mil/Portals/90/Documents/RV/A%20Primer%20on%20Cislunar%20Space_Dist%20A_PA2021-1271.pdf?ver=vs6e0sE4PuJ51QC-15DEfg%3D%3D, https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AEtherJournal/Journals/Special-Edition_Winter2023/Willis.pdf].

These points are strategically important for space domain awareness. For example, to effectively observe other objects within the cislunar environment, satellites can be placed in specific orbits, such as Lyapunov orbits, around the L1 and L2 Lagrange points. This positioning allows for comprehensive monitoring of the Earth-Moon system [https://cdcl.umd.edu/papers/icssa20.pdf].

Search Query: orbital mechanics of Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHO) and Distant Retrograde Orbits (DRO) in cislunar space
Search Answer: A key strategy for conducting comprehensive situational awareness and supporting short-term tracking of targets in cislunar space involves leveraging the unique properties of specific orbits, such as Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs) and Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs). These are considered potential "parking orbits" for stations and monitoring assets ["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576521002526"].

NRHOs, first identified within the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem (CR3BP) model of the Earth-Moon system, are part of the L1 and L2 halo orbit families ["https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/Publications/Conferences/2017_IAA_ZimHowDav.pdf"]. They offer several advantages for long-term missions:
*   **Stability:** They possess favorable stability properties, which allow for long-duration missions with minimal propellant consumption for station-keeping ["https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/Publications/Conferences/2017_IAA_ZimHowDav.pdf"].
*   **Accessibility:** They allow for relatively inexpensive transfer options from Earth and feasible transfers to the lunar surface and other cislunar orbits ["https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/Publications/Conferences/2017_IAA_ZimHowDav.pdf"].
*   **Favorable Geometry:** They have advantageous eclipsing properties that can be designed to avoid lunar eclipses, ensuring consistent power and communication ["https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/Publications/Conferences/2017_IAA_ZimHowDav.pdf"].

The dynamic relationship between these orbits is crucial for effective monitoring and tracking tasks. Research is actively focused on finding efficient transfer trajectories between NRHOs and DROs ["https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210007698"]. This has practical applications in mission planning, such as positioning monitoring or rescue spacecraft in DROs to perform rapid rendezvous operations with a target in an NRHO. One study showed that a constellation of two rescue spacecraft in DROs and other orbits could rendezvous with a craft in an NRHO in less than one day, demonstrating how strategic positioning in these orbits can support effective short-term tracking and monitoring in cislunar space ["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468896724000557"].

Search Query: impact of three-body problem dynamics on cislunar space object tracking versus two-body mechanics
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in cislunar space, it is essential to move beyond simple two-body mechanics and address the complexities of the three-body problem [https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/40560/two-body-problem-vs-three-body-problem-applications, https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=24989.0]. The motion of objects in the Earth-Moon system is best described by the restricted three-body problem, where an object of negligible mass is influenced by the gravitational pull of both the Earth and the Moon. A common, less computationally expensive approximation for this is the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117724009189].

The primary impact of these dynamics on tracking and monitoring is the introduction of complex, less predictable trajectories compared to the stable orbits found in two-body mechanics. Three-body dynamics introduce phenomena such as Lagrange points, halo orbits, and invariant manifolds, which do not exist in simpler models [https://ross.aoe.vt.edu/books/Ross_3BodyProblem_Book_2022.pdf]. Furthermore, studies show that under these dynamics, debris from breakup or fragmentation events can scatter and travel far beyond the original orbit, significantly complicating tracking and behavior prediction [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117724009189].

Supporting short-term tracking and monitoring tasks requires specific computational methods. While two-body mechanics are insufficient on their own, they can serve as a baseline. For instance, Encke's method calculates an object's trajectory by integrating the difference between its actual path in an n-body system and a reference two-body orbit [https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=24989.0]. For even greater accuracy and more precise risk assessments, tracking models may need to incorporate the gravitational effects of the Sun and Jupiter, effectively treating the challenge as a Restricted Four-Body Problem [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117724009189].

Search Query: cislunar object population survey including government and commercial actors like NASA Artemis and Chinese Lunar Exploration Program
Search Answer: A key component of conducting comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of targets in cislunar space is understanding the significant number of planned missions that will require tracking and monitoring. Based on a survey of uncrewed cislunar missions planned between 2024 and 2033, a large volume of activity is expected from numerous government and commercial entities worldwide [0].

Search Query: tracking challenges for cislunar population growth specifically rocket bodies debris and low-thrust spacecraft
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive situational awareness and support short-term tracking of targets in cislunar space, efforts are focused on overcoming the primary challenge: the vast distances involved, which make monitoring difficult [https://newspaceeconomy.ca/2024/09/28/cislunar-space-debris-increasing-concerns/]. The growing population of objects, including rocket bodies, debris, and low-thrust spacecraft, is an increasing concern for academic researchers [https://spacenews.com/university-researchers-flag-cislunar-space-debris-concerns/, https://spacesecurity.wse.jhu.edu/2024/09/29/university-researchers-flag-cislunar-space-debris-concerns/].

In response to these challenges, several initiatives are underway:
*   **Debris Tracking Studies:** Studies are being conducted to establish future requirements for tracking debris in cislunar orbits [https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/orbitaldebris2023/pdf/6105.pdf].
*   **Advanced Military Programs:** The U.S. military is actively seeking new methods to track objects in this domain. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated a program called Track at Big Distances with Track-Before-Detect (TBD2). This program aims to create new ways to process optical signals for the continuous, space-based detection and tracking of objects that are transiting or originating from cislunar space. The ultimate goal is to enhance early warning capabilities for potential threats and other objects of interest [https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/us-military-wants-to-track-potential-threats-coming-from-the-moon].

Search Query: limitations of the Space Surveillance Network (SSN) ground-based sensors for cislunar domain awareness
Search Answer: Ground-based sensors from the Space Surveillance Network (SSN) are insufficient for conducting comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in the cislunar space, creating significant blind spots [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322399511_Challenges_and_Potential_in_Space_Domain_Awareness]. The limitations of these sensors are compounded by the vastness of the cislunar region and include restricted fields of view, inadequate observational power, and susceptibility to cloud cover [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359014581_Expanding_the_Space_Surveillance_Network_with_Space-Based_Sensors_Using_Metaheuristic_Optimization_Techniques].

According to performance analysis, current ground-based systems achieve only 56.4% observability of the cislunar region, with a maximum observation or tracking gap time of 24 hours. It is projected that even future ground-based systems would only reach 64.5% observability [https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Poster/Bloom.pdf]. Consequently, conducting Space Domain Awareness (SDA) in the cislunar volume is considered infeasible with any single Electro-Optical or Infrared (EO/IR) sensor system, including a ground-based network alone [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/393975299_System_Design_and_Analysis_for_Cislunar_Space_Domain_Awareness_Through_Distributed_Sensors].

Search Query: proposed space-based sensor constellations for cislunar SSA including architectures at Lagrange points and DARPA's "Track at Big Distances with Track-Before-Detect" (TBD2) methods
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in cislunar space and support short-term tracking and monitoring, several methods and architectures have been proposed. These include government programs and academic frameworks for satellite constellation design [https://sam.gov/opp/43a52cc42f5f420bb0c11452ace42d6f/view, https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/track-at-big-distances-with-track-before-detect-t-darpa-ps-26-01-o-ae224/, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383060120_Cislunar_Constellation_Design_for_Space_Situational_Awareness_with_Time-Expanded_Facility_Location_Problem].

Two key approaches are:
*   **DARPA's TBD2 Program** The "Track at Big Distances with Track-Before-Detect" (TBD2) program from DARPA aims to enable continuous, space-based detection and tracking of objects in cislunar space. The objective is to achieve this on tactical timelines to improve safety and awareness in this domain [https://sam.gov/opp/43a52cc42f5f420bb0c11452ace42d6f/view, https://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/track-at-big-distances-with-track-before-detect-t-darpa-ps-26-01-o-ae224/].

*   **Constellation Design using a Facility Location Problem Framework** Another proposed method for Cislunar Space Situational Awareness (SSA) involves designing satellite constellations using a facility location problem framework. This approach seeks to determine the optimal placement for space-based observers to effectively monitor a specific cislunar region. One application of this method involves locating sensors, or "facilities," in discretized slots along Lagrange Point Orbits (LPOs). This framework also addresses the challenge of sensor tasking by allocating observers to specific pointing directions based on their field of view (FOV), rather than assigning them only to individual targets [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383060120_Cislunar_Constellation_Design_for_Space_Situational_Awareness_with_Time-Expanded_Facility_Location_Problem, https://arxiv.org/html/2408.06238v1].

Search Query: technical trade-offs of optical telescopes vs high-power radar vs passive RF sensing for detecting and characterizing objects in cislunar space
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in cislunar space and support short-term tracking and monitoring, a multi-modal, layered approach is necessary. No single sensor can provide a complete picture of the cislunar domain; therefore, combining the strengths of optical telescopes, high-power radar, and passive radio frequency (RF) sensing is the most effective strategy.

The technical trade-offs for each sensor type are as follows:

### Optical Telescopes

Optical telescopes are considered the "workhorse" and primary method for current cislunar Space Situational Awareness (SSA) [0, 6, 7].

*   **Advantages**:
    *   **Effective at Long Distances**: They are cost-effective and well-suited for the vast distances of cislunar space, where radars struggle [3, 5, 7].
    *   **Excellent Angular Data**: They provide excellent angular positional data (astrometry), such as azimuth and elevation, and can measure an object's brightness (photometry) to help determine its size [3, 4].
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   **Environmental and Geometric Limitations**: Ground-based telescopes are dependent on weather, can only operate at night, and are subject to atmospheric interference [0, 7, 8, 9]. They also require specific lighting conditions where the sun reflects off the target [4, 6].
    *   **No Range Data**: A significant drawback is that optical sensors provide poor or no range data [4].
*   **Future Developments**: To overcome these limitations, space-based optical telescopes, such as those planned for the Cislunar Highway Patrol System (CHPS), are being developed. These can provide more persistent surveillance from advantageous orbits and can be more sensitive than ground-based telescopes of the same size [2, 3, 9].

### High-Power Radar

Radar systems excel in certain areas but face significant challenges at cislunar distances.

*   **Advantages**:
    *   **Precise Range and Velocity**: Radar is the preferred sensor for lower orbits because it provides highly accurate range and range-rate (velocity) measurements, which are crucial for precise orbit determination [1, 3, 4, 7].
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   **Distance Limitations**: Radar's effectiveness diminishes drastically at cislunar distances due to the “tyranny of the fourth power law,” where the required power scales with the fourth power of the distance [3, 8]. This makes tracking objects beyond geosynchronous orbit (GEO) extremely expensive and power-intensive [6, 7]. Even advanced systems like the Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability (DARC) are designed for distances up to GEO (approx. 36,000 km), which falls short of cislunar space [8].
    *   **Poor Angular Data**: Compared to optical systems, radars provide poor angular position data [4].

### Passive RF Sensing

Passive RF sensing involves intercepting signals emitted by active satellites.

*   **Advantages**:
    *   **Characterization of Active Satellites**: This method is useful for detecting, tracking, and characterizing active satellites by intercepting their communication or navigation signals, which helps determine their function and status [3, 6, 8].
    *   **Cueing and Precision Data**: It can provide cueing information for other sensors and, like radar, can offer very precise range and velocity measurements [1, 9].
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   **Limited to Active Targets**: The primary limitation is that it can only detect objects that are actively transmitting signals. It is ineffective for tracking inactive or non-cooperative satellites, space debris, or natural objects [3, 6, 9].

### A Combined, Layered Approach

Given the distinct advantages and limitations of each sensor type, a hybrid or networked strategy is required for comprehensive and accurate situational awareness. By combining the excellent angular data from optical sensors with the precise range and range-rate data from RF or radar systems, a complete and accurate state vector (position and velocity) of a cislunar object can be determined [1, 4].

This integrated approach is exemplified by systems like the Air Force Research Laboratory's CHIMERA instrument, which combines optical and RF sensors [1], and the development of space-based platforms like CHPS, which aim to overcome the limitations of ground-based systems [0, 3, 7].

Search Query: algorithms for cislunar initial orbit determination and trajectory prediction using sparse optical data from multi-body gravitational models like CR3BP
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in cislunar space and support short-term tracking and monitoring, various advanced algorithms are being developed for initial orbit determination (IOD) using sparse optical data. These algorithms are designed to handle the complexities of multi-body gravitational models characteristic of the cislunar environment.

A prominent advanced technique is the **collocation-based IOD algorithm**. This novel approach uses collocation and nonlinear programming to reconstruct an object's state trajectory and control history from optical angle measurements. It represents a significant improvement over traditional methods, demonstrating higher accuracy and a better convergence rate, even over long measurement intervals and with limited initial guess information. This method has proven highly reliable for reconstructing multi-body orbits from sparse data over short observing arcs when compared to traditional shooting methods and baseline approaches like an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

In addition to the collocation method, other algorithms are used and studied for cislunar IOD:
*   **Differential Corrections Algorithm**: A novel method developed for the cislunar region that can function with as few as three angle-only measurements.
*   **Gooding's Algorithm**: A traditional IOD process often used as a benchmark for comparison with newer methods.
*   **MCCLOD**: An IOD method that is used in analyses, sometimes paired with a regression model. The acronym has been variously expanded as "Multi-epoch, Cislunar, and Constrained-Admissible-Region, Lambert-based Orbit Determination" and "Multi-Correlation Cislunar Orbit Determination".
*   **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**: Frequently used as a baseline orbit determination approach, particularly with maneuver detection, for comparison against more advanced algorithms.
*   **Batch Least Squares (BLS) Filter**: An algorithm mentioned in the context of processing the results from IOD.

The primary goal in developing these advanced algorithms is to enable a large convergence region with minimal a priori knowledge and to provide accurate solutions despite long gaps between measurements, thereby supporting the effectiveness of cislunar space tracking and monitoring tasks.

Search Query: strategies and challenges for multi-source data fusion and cataloging for cislunar space situational awareness
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness and support short-term tracking of targets in cislunar space, several strategies have been proposed. These include the long-term planning of observational strategies, the development of both space- and ground-based observational tools, and the use of multi-source data fusion and cataloging [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AGUFMSA12A..05G/abstract].

Another method to address these challenges is to formulate an optimization problem for managing multi-spacecraft systems. This approach aims to enhance Cislunar Space Domain Awareness (SDA) and support the effectiveness of tracking and monitoring tasks [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372205114_Optimizing_Multi-spacecraft_Cislunar_Space_Domain_Awareness_Systems_via_Hidden-Genes_Genetic_Algorithm].

Search Query: application of AI and machine learning for cislunar sensor tasking and anomaly detection
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in cislunar space and support short-term tracking and monitoring, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are applied to enhance Space Situational Awareness (SSA) [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/950954, https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/space-habitation/call-for-papers/ai-enabled-cislunar-space-situational-awareness/]. These technologies improve the detection, recognition, tracking, and prediction of space objects' movements, which helps lower the risk of collisions [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/950954, https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/space-habitation/call-for-papers/ai-enabled-cislunar-space-situational-awareness/].

Specific applications of AI and ML in cislunar SSA include:
*   **Orbital Cataloging and Classification**: AI enhances the cataloging and classification of objects, which is particularly useful in the complex gravitational environments of cislunar space [https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/space-habitation/call-for-papers/ai-enabled-cislunar-space-situational-awareness/].
*   **Sensor Tasking**: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents are employed for sensor tasking. Monte Carlo simulations have shown that these agents can outperform random policies by maximizing the number of unique Resident Space Objects (RSOs) visited by sensors [https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Poster/Siew.pdf].
*   **Anomaly and Maneuver Detection**: ML is used for satellite maneuver detection, sometimes with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It is also applied to data fusion to identify satellite anomalies, which can be caused by factors like space weather [https://amostech.space/track/machine-learning-for-ssa-applications/].
*   **Object Characterization and Assessment**: Other applications in Space Domain Awareness (SDA) involve using ML for object detection, satellite characterization, and conjunction assessment, with Graph Neural Networks being a technique used for the latter two [https://amostech.space/track/machine-learning-for-ssa-applications/].

The range of techniques used for these applications encompasses machine learning, neural networks (including Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks), and symbolic automated reasoning [https://amostech.space/track/machine-learning-for-ssa-applications/, https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1910.03014].

Search Query: applications of cislunar SSA for collision avoidance, rendezvous and proximity operations, and threat characterization
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in cislunar space for short-term tracking and monitoring, research has focused on applying Cislunar Space Situational Awareness (SSA) to rendezvous and proximity operations using specific dynamics models for estimation and control [https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/10/8/674, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372791517_Rendezvous_and_Proximity_Operations_in_Cislunar_Space_Using_Linearized_Dynamics_for_Estimation].

Key methods and applications include:
*   **Linearized Dynamics Models:** One approach uses the matrix exponential linearized relative circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) equations as a dynamics model. This model is used for state estimation and to simulate optimal rendezvous maneuvers between spacecraft, such as a "chief" and "deputy" spacecraft, even when accounting for measurement noise [https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/10/8/674, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372791517_Rendezvous_and_Proximity_Operations_in_Cislunar_Space_Using_Linearized_Dynamics_for_Estimation].
*   **Integrated Navigation and Control:** Other frameworks integrate navigation and control systems to support autonomous spacecraft operations, such as rendezvous and precise landings, in the cislunar environment. These systems can incorporate technologies like LiDAR [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/394384917_Spacecraft_Rendezvous_and_Precise_Landing_in_the_Cislunar_Region_with_a_LiDAR].
*   **Collision Avoidance:** SSA is critical for collision avoidance, particularly for remotely controlled satellites. The significant communication delays in cislunar space make effective SSA essential for distinguishing between a successful docking maneuver and a "catastrophic collision" [https://doaj.org/article/4c048b4229f74e558d0c723a4e973227].

Search Query: methods for cislunar data correlation and uncertainty quantification to build a unified catalog from multi-source SSA data
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in cislunar space and support short-term tracking and monitoring, several methods for uncertainty quantification and orbit determination have been proposed.

These methods include:
*   **Multi-Fidelity Approach**: This approach is used to efficiently and rapidly propagate the orbit state uncertainty of cislunar objects. The state uncertainty is represented as an ensemble of particles or sigma points.
*   **Multi-Order Shooting Scheme**: This is a proposed method specifically for the initial orbit determination of cislunar targets.
*   **Generative AI Architectures**: These are being explored for thermospheric density prediction and its associated uncertainty quantification, which are critical factors in accurate tracking.

It is important to note that the term "unified catalog" found in the source material refers to a data source management tool for databases and not a catalog of cislunar objects. The sources did not contain information on methods for cislunar data correlation.

Search Query: cislunar multi-source data correlation and association techniques for unified object cataloging
Search Answer: In the multi-body dynamics of cislunar space, traditional initial orbit determination techniques often fail or are prone to failure due to the Too-Short Arc (TSA) problem [1]. Consequently, to support effective tracking and monitoring, maintaining a unified object catalog for cislunar orbits is necessary. This will require the development of new sensors and a substantially expanded set of algorithms [2].

Search Query: policy and legal frameworks for cislunar space traffic management and international data sharing agreements
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive situational awareness and support short-term tracking of space targets in cislunar space, a specialized framework for Cislunar Space Traffic Management (CSTM) is urgently needed. While this is an area of active development, establishing such a system faces significant policy, legal, and political challenges [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391481695_Weak_Signals_in_Cislunar_Space_Traffic_Management_How_can_policy_to_facilitate_CSTM_be_designed_to_adapt_to_unexpected_events_and_emerging_trends].

A notable step toward creating the necessary international legal frameworks is "The Cologne Manual on Space Traffic Management" [https://ilwr.jura.uni-koeln.de/sites/ilwr/user_upload/CM-STM_2025__Guidelines.pdf]. However, several obstacles hinder the establishment of binding regulations required for effective tracking and monitoring:
*   **Lack of Consensus and Data Sharing:** There is a lack of international consensus on the urgency of the issue, and critically, there is no legally binding agreement to provide Space Situational Awareness (SSA) data and processed information [https://www.unoosa.org/res/oosadoc/data/documents/2025/aac_105c_22025crp/aac_105c_22025crp_23_0_html/AC105_C2_2025_CRP23E.pdf].
*   **Coordination and Responsibility:** States are often reluctant to coordinate orbit selection processes. Furthermore, there is a lack of specific regulations for determining collision avoidance responsibility and for establishing liability standards for damage from space operations [https://www.unoosa.org/res/oosadoc/data/documents/2025/aac_105c_22025crp/aac_105c_22025crp_23_0_html/AC105_C2_2025_CRP23E.pdf].
*   **Prioritization:** The framework lacks a system for prioritizing different space activities, including military operations [https://www.unoosa.org/res/oosadoc/data/documents/2025/aac_105c_22025crp/aac_105c_22025crp_23_0_html/AC105_C2_2025_CRP23E.pdf].

Addressing these long-term challenges serves as a call to action for stakeholders. Further study is required on regulatory issues, such as the economic impact of STM on private commercial activities, to pave the way for successful and sustainable missions in cislunar space [https://hal.science/hal-05067616v1/file/DTIS2025-009-Pre-proof-Accept%C3%A9e.pdf, https://www.unoosa.org/res/oosadoc/data/documents/2025/aac_105c_22025crp/aac_105c_22025crp_23_0_html/AC105_C2_2025_CRP23E.pdf].

Search Query: algorithms and frameworks for solving the Too-Short Arc (TSA) data association and tracklet correlation problem for cislunar object catalog maintenance
Search Answer: To support effective short-term tracking and monitoring of space targets in cislunar space, one significant challenge to address is the Too-Short Arc (TSA) data association and tracklet correlation problem. An approach to solve this is to associate multiple short-arc tracklets with specific targets across various time intervals [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326567294_Improved_tracklet_association_for_space_objects_using_short-arc_optical_measurements].

To improve upon existing techniques, a novel tracklet association method has been developed. This enhanced method integrates admissible regions with nonlinear approaches to more effectively link data [https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.G008069].

Search Query: methods and challenges for threat assessment and object characterization of non-cooperative targets in cislunar space
Search Answer: To conduct comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets, particularly non-cooperative ones in cislunar space, methods focus on observing and analyzing satellite behavior and maneuvers. These approaches support short-term tracking and monitoring by identifying unusual or potentially threatening activities.

Key methods for threat assessment and characterization include:

*   **Tracking High-Velocity Maneuvers**: Monitoring for unusually high-speed movements is a critical assessment method. For instance, China's TJS-2 satellite was observed maneuvering at 44 meters per second, a rate significantly more fuel-intensive than the standard 0.5 to 1 m/s.
*   **Observing Orbital Positioning**: A satellite's position relative to other objects can indicate its intent. An example is the Chinese TJS-4 satellite, which maneuvered to place itself between the sun and a U.S. space surveillance satellite, potentially creating shadows to obstruct the U.S. satellite's ability to take photographs.
*   **Monitoring Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO)**: Tracking satellites that operate in close proximity is another key technique. Observed examples include China's SY-24C-03 and SJ-6-05A conducting RPO with a closest approach of less than one kilometer, and Russia's Cosmos 2581 and Cosmos 2582 moving in formation as close as 100 meters apart. Such operations could suggest activities like refueling or servicing. For example, China's SJ-25 satellite entered a coplanar orbit with SJ-21, a satellite known for previously moving a defunct satellite, which may indicate a potential refueling mission.
*   **Detecting Entry into Coplanar Orbits**: A notable event for characterization is when a satellite enters the same orbital plane as another nation's satellite. Russia's Cosmos 2576, for instance, entered a coplanar orbit with the U.S. government satellite USA 314.
*   **Analyzing Complex Flight Patterns**: Non-cooperative targets can be characterized by observing unusual flight patterns. An example includes the "corkscrew maneuvers" conducted by the Chinese SY-24C satellites around another satellite.

Additionally, the characterization of resident space objects for surveillance and tracking is a subject of ongoing academic research partnerships.

Search Query: roadmap for cislunar space situational awareness identifying technology gaps and investment priorities
Search Answer: A roadmap for conducting comprehensive and accurate situational awareness of space targets in cislunar space is outlined in the U.S. National Cislunar Science and Technology Strategy and an accompanying Action Plan released by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) [https://spacenews.com/ostp-releases-cislunar-science-and-technology-plans/, https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11-2022-NSTC-National-Cislunar-ST-Strategy.pdf, https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cislunar-Implementation-Plan-Final.pdf]. This strategy establishes a vision for U.S. leadership in the responsible and sustainable use of the cislunar environment [https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11-2022-NSTC-National-Cislunar-ST-Strategy.pdf].

To support the effectiveness of cislunar space tracking and monitoring, the strategy sets forth several key objectives to guide research, development, and investment:
*   Support research and development for future growth in cislunar space [https://space.commerce.gov/white-house-releases-national-cislunar-st-strategy/].
*   Expand international science and technology cooperation [https://spacenews.com/ostp-releases-cislunar-science-and-technology-plans/, https://space.commerce.gov/white-house-releases-national-cislunar-st-strategy/].
*   Extend U.S. space situational awareness (SSA) capabilities into cislunar space [https://spacenews.com/ostp-releases-cislunar-science-and-technology-plans/, https://space.commerce.gov/white-house-releases-national-cislunar-st-strategy/].
*   Develop cislunar communication and navigation systems [https://spacenews.com/ostp-releases-cislunar-science-and-technology-plans/].

Furthermore, a thesis from MIT that evaluated existing SSA architectures identified key technology and system gaps that need to be addressed for effective cislunar SSA. These areas requiring improvement include infrastructure, acquisition strategies, policy-driven timelines, and communication structures [https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/162417/rude-rudc6118-sm-tpp-2025-thesis.pdf.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y].

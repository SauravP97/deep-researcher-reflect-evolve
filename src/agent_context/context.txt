Search Query: sociolinguistic analysis of gendered first-person pronouns and sentence-final particles in modern Japanese
Search Answer: While there is no specific information in the provided research on how shoujo manga consumption affects pronoun and sentence-ending particle use among queer young adults in Japan, the sources offer a general sociolinguistic analysis of gendered language in the country.

In modern Japanese, first-person pronouns and sentence-final particles are often gendered. The pronoun *watashi* is typically used by women, while *boku* is standard for men [https://eall.columbian.gwu.edu/japanese-gendered-first-person-pronouns-norms-and-innovation-identity-works]. This gendering is a reflection of Meiji government policies from the late 19th to early 20th centuries, which established a modern language (*kokugo*) that positioned male speakers as the primary citizens [https://eall.columbian.gwu.edu/japanese-gendered-first-person-pronouns-norms-and-innovation-identity-works].

However, these linguistic norms are not rigid. Speakers, especially girls, often break these conventions to construct new and novel identities [https://eall.columbian.gwu.edu/japanese-gendered-first-person-pronouns-norms-and-innovation-identity-works]. The choice of a pronoun can be influenced by various factors, including group membership, age, and the speaker's relationship to the listener [https://eall.columbian.gwu.edu/japanese-gendered-first-person-pronouns-norms-and-innovation-identity-works].

Sentence-final particles are also linked to gender, though there can be conflicting sociolinguistic accounts regarding the specific usage of certain particles, such as *wa* [https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/publications/gender-and-the-sentence-final-particles-in-japanese, https://kb.osu.edu/bitstreams/19805a1d-86b1-478a-b6a4-39f4f80296ff/download].

There is a trend in contemporary spoken Japanese towards more neutral language. Speakers often personalize their speech by using established archetypes of "women's language" (*joseigo*) and "men's language" (*danseigo*) to construct their own identities as they see fit, depending on the social context [https://studenttheses.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A3447241/view]. While a direct link to shoujo manga isn't established here, academic work does exist concerning the language used by LGBT+ individuals in Japan, as well as analyses of gendered speech patterns in anime and how they express character personalities [https://studenttheses.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A3447241/view].

Search Query: linguistic characteristics of "joseigo" and "danseigo" focusing on first-person pronouns and sentence-final particles
Search Answer: In Japanese, gendered language is categorized into distinct speech styles known as "joseigo" (women's language) and "danseigo" (men's language). These styles are often considered types of *yakuwarigo*, or "role language," which are constructed and reinforced through factors like education and media. Stereotypically, joseigo is characterized as gentle, polite, indirect, and refined, while danseigo is considered more direct and rough. These differences are most apparent in the use of first-person pronouns and sentence-final particles.

### **First-Person Pronouns**

**Feminine Pronouns (Joseigo):**
*   **Atashi (あたし):** An informal, softer, and more feminine version of *watashi*.
*   **Uchi (うち):** Another common pronoun associated with female speakers.

**Masculine Pronouns (Danseigo):**
*   **Ore (俺):** A very informal and rough-sounding pronoun used to signal masculinity and familiarity. It is typically used among equals or towards those of lower status and can be perceived as arrogant if used inappropriately.
*   **Boku (僕):** An informal masculine pronoun that has a softer feel than *ore*. It is often used by younger men and can convey casualness or a sense of deference.
*   **Washi (わし):** Another pronoun typically used by men.
*   **Jibun (自分):** Also associated with male speakers.

**Gender-Neutral / Formal Pronouns:**
*   **Watashi (私):** The most common and polite first-person pronoun, which is considered gender-neutral and can be used by anyone, especially in formal situations.
*   **Watakushi (わたくし):** A more formal version of *watashi*, also used by all genders in highly formal contexts.

### **Sentence-Final Particles**

**Feminine Particles (Joseigo):**
Feminine particles are often used to soften a statement or add emotional color. It is noted that the use of these particles can be more common in fiction and media than in everyday conversation.
*   **Wa (わ):** Softens a statement or expresses emotion. It can appear in variations like *wa yo* and *wa ne*.
*   **No (の):** Can make a question sound softer or be used to offer an explanation in a gentle tone.
*   **Kashira (かしら):** Used to express uncertainty, similar to "I wonder."

**Masculine Particles (Danseigo):**
Masculine particles are often used to add force or emphasis to a statement.
*   **Zo (ぞ) and Ze (ぜ):** Used to add emphasis.
*   **Yo (よ):** Adds force or emphasis to a statement.
*   **Da (だ):** A declarative particle.
*   **Na (な):** A common masculine particle.
*   Compound forms such as **Daze (だぜ)** and **Dazo (だぞ)** are also characteristic of this speech style.

Search Query: history and common themes of shoujo manga genre
Search Answer: Shōjo manga first appeared in general magazines for teenagers in the early 1900s and began to formalize as its own distinct category in the 1950s. Many consider the work of Osamu Tezuka to be the starting point for modern shōjo manga, while the 1960s saw the rise of influential female artists, notably the "Year 24 Group."

The genre has been influential in shaping girl's culture in Japan and often explores themes relevant to gender and personal expression:
*   **Love and Romance:** The eternal and central theme of the genre is love. This can include "boys' love" (male-male romance) and stories focusing on gentle and loving male relationships.
*   **Gender and Sexuality:** Shōjo manga frequently delves into internal questions of gender identity and sexuality. A highly influential example is *The Rose of Versailles*, which touches on themes of gender, sexuality, and feminism through its protagonist, Lady Oscar, who is raised as a man.
*   **Other Common Themes:** Other recurring elements include drama, feminism, class, royalty, and historical settings, often drawing from the 18th and 19th centuries.

The visual style of shōjo manga often emphasizes fashion and a distinct aesthetic. Male characters are frequently portrayed as *bishōnen* (beautiful boys) with feminine appearances, such as graceful bodies and long, flowing hair, often in fantastical or historical environments. The art style is also characterized by a focus on elaborate outfits and details in the characters' eyes and flowing hair.

Search Query: linguistic analysis of shoujo manga character dialogue focusing on gendered pronouns, "bokukko", and sentence-final particles
Search Answer: While manga is popularly perceived in Japan as a source of linguistic change and is often cited as a reason young women use masculine first-person pronouns like *ore* and *boku*, linguistic analyses of the medium present a more nuanced picture.

Studies of popular shoujo manga have found a contrast between this perception and the actual dialogue used by characters. One such analysis found no examples of female characters using the masculine pronouns *ore* or *boku*. However, this study did note a relevant instance concerning gender identity: a male, female-identifying transsexual character used the feminine pronoun *atashi*. In a related observation from a study of male-oriented manga, female characters more commonly used the standard pronoun "watashi" over the more feminine "atashi".

Other analyses focusing on the speech patterns in shojo (girls') and ladies' (women's) manga observe how gender identity is expressed through language more broadly. These studies note that older female characters, particularly in ladies' manga, tend to use more traditional speech patterns compared to younger characters in shojo manga, who use different linguistic forms. Some research also explores the use of masculine language by female characters as a means of expressing gender identity.

Search Query: prevalence of female characters using masculine pronouns ("bokukko") in shoujo manga academic studies
Search Answer: Contrary to the popular perception that manga influences young women to use masculine first-person pronouns like 'ore' and 'boku', one academic study of popular manga found no instances of female characters using such pronouns. However, the same study did find one instance of a male, female-identifying transsexual character using the feminine pronoun 'atashi' [https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574].

Search Query: social and cultural context of the queer (セクシュアル・マイノリティ) community in Japan and their relationship with mainstream media
Search Answer: While there is no specific information regarding the influence of shoujo manga on pronoun use and sentence-ending particles among queer Japanese young adults, the available research provides broader context on Japan's queer community and its relationship with mass media.

Historically, Japanese culture has shown a degree of acceptance toward diverse sexual orientations, as evidenced in traditional art and literature. There was a time in the nation's history when individuals did not feel the need to hide their sexual orientation [https://bokksu.com/blogs/news/embracing-diversity-the-lgbtq-community-in-japan?srsltid=AfmBOorsh7wJyMRoQwwI7bdm2h3gudB1t9DdMGr, https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/35549/3/The%20LGBTQ%2B%20culture%20and%20Japanese%20society-%20Steinunn%20Steinarsdo%CC%81ttir.pdf].

In contemporary Japan, however, the queer community is often described as "shy." Many LGBTQ+ individuals fear harassment or a negative change in their social position if they come out, which contributes to an ongoing struggle for basic rights. Furthermore, social acceptance varies by region, sometimes being described as a "prefecture thing" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX3ne7fVgTE, https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/35549/3/The%20LGBTQ%2B%20culture%20and%20Japanese%20society-%20Steinunn%20Steinarsdo%CC%81ttir.pdf].

Within this social landscape, certain media genres have become a significant part of contemporary queer culture. 'Boy's Love' (BL), for example, is increasingly accepted in the mainstream and is considered a powerful form of cultural representation for the community in Japan [https://slashqueer.com/the-queer-media-of-contemporary-japan-transcript].

Search Query: sociolinguistic studies of language use and speech patterns in the Japanese LGBTQ+ community
Search Answer: Sociolinguistic studies on the language of Japan's LGBTQ+ community exist within the broader field of queer linguistics, which examines the interaction between language, gender, and sexuality [https://www.academia.edu/44020849/Language_and_Sexuality_Language_and_LGBTQ_Communities]. Specific academic research has explored the speech patterns of various groups, including Japanese lesbian women and gay male couples [https://repository.arizona.edu/bitstream/10150/195371/1/azu_etd_1057, https://www.academia.edu/44020849/Language_and_Sexuality_Language_and_LGBTQ_Communities]. One study also examined the "discursive construction of queer spatiality" among contemporary queer women in Japan [https://academic.oup.com/book/6883/chapter/151099349].

A recent thesis titled "QUEER JAPANESE" analyzed the speech of LGBTQ+ individuals featured in the documentary "Queer Japan" and found that some older observations about gendered language use in the community may no longer be accurate [https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/70422]. The study did not support earlier findings that lesbian women used more masculine language and gay men used more feminine language. The research concludes that such distinct gendered language seems to be becoming "obsolete" and persists more as a "stereotype or forced image" rather than a feature of active, everyday use by community members [https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/70422, https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/handle/2077/70422/gupea_2077_70422_1.pdf?sequence=1].

Search Query: linguistic analysis of pronouns and sentence-final particles in Boys' Love (BL) manga character dialogue
Search Answer: Linguistic analysis of Boys' Love (BL) manga, a genre popular among queer audiences, reveals distinct patterns in the use of gendered pronouns and sentence-final particles to construct character archetypes, particularly the dominant *seme* and the submissive *uke* [1, 2, 6].

**Speech Patterns of *Seme* (Dominant) Characters:**
*Seme* characters consistently use language that performs a stereotypical or even hyper-masculinity. This is achieved through the frequent use of the first-person pronoun *ore* (俺), which is considered assertive and strongly masculine [1, 2]. Some characters may even use the more dominant form *ore-sama* [2]. Their speech is also marked by assertive and traditionally masculine sentence-final particles such as *ze* (ぜ), *zo* (ぞ), and *da* (だ) [1, 2, 6]. While particles like *ze* and *zo* can be considered somewhat archaic in modern spoken Japanese, they are used in manga to signify a specific type of assertive masculinity [1].

**Speech Patterns of *Uke* (Submissive) Characters:**
The speech of *uke* characters is more complex, often creating a "gender-ambiguous" style [2, 4, 5]. While they also use masculine pronouns, they tend to favor *boku* (僕), which conveys a softer, gentler, or more boyish masculinity compared to *ore* [1, 2].

The most notable feature of *uke* speech is the combination of these masculine pronouns with stereotypically feminine sentence-final particles, such as *wa* (わ), *no* (の), and *kashira* (かしら) [1, 2, 5]. A study analyzing 30 volumes of BL manga found that *uke* characters used feminine sentence-final particles in 34% of their applicable sentences, with *wa* being the most frequent, whereas *seme* characters used them 0% of the time [2, 5].

While some analyses note that *uke* characters still largely conform to masculine speech patterns, this specific and frequent blending of masculine pronouns with feminine particles is a distinct linguistic choice used to portray their character as gentle or soft, creating a clear contrast with the hyper-masculine *seme* [1, 6].

**Connection to *Onee Kotoba* (Queer Feminine Speech):**
This linguistic portrayal in BL manga is related to a broader media trope in Japan known as *onee kotoba*, a stereotyped speech style associated with gay men and transgender women [1, 3, 6]. *Onee kotoba* is typically marked by feminine first-person pronouns like *atashi* and feminine sentence-final particles such as *wa*, *no*, and *kashira* [1, 3]. While some gay men in Japan adopt these speech patterns as part of their identity, younger speakers may opt for a more neutral style to avoid being stereotyped [1, 3]. The language used by *uke* characters in BL manga often borrows elements from this trope, particularly the use of feminine sentence-final particles, to construct their specific persona within the narrative.

Search Query: Japanese queer community online language use adoption of BL manga yakuwarigo
Search Answer: Research into Japanese mass media and language confirms the existence of *yakuwarigo*, or "role language"—stylized character idiolects common in anime and manga that often embed gendered roles [https://silvajp.web.amu.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Silva-Iaponicarum-64-65.pdf, https://oajournals.fupress.net/index.php/bsfm-lea/article/download/14474/13726/31943]. Academic work is currently investigating how these fictional speech patterns are reflected in the language of real-world Japanese speakers [https://japan.univie.ac.at/startseite/einzelnews/news/yakuwarigo-real-or-fictionalized-speech-how-real-japanese-influences-role-languages-and-how-role/].

In the context of the queer community, studies show that BL (Boys' Love) manga magazines have helped create an "underground queer community." Within this space, readers have used *bishōnen* (beautiful boy) characters as self-inserts to better understand their own genders and sexualities [https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/EJAS/article/view/199551].

However, while a dissertation on the language of the LGBTQ+ community in Japan is underway, the provided sources do not contain specific findings that confirm whether the queer community adopts pronoun usage or sentence-ending particles from the shoujo or BL manga they consume [https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/handle/2077/70422/gupea_2077_70422_1.pdf?sequence=1].

Search Query: shoujo manga themes androgyny non-traditional relationships queer audience reception analysis
Search Answer: Shōjo manga are romance comics created for a teenage girl audience, known for their dense, flowery visual style and androgynous, big-eyed male characters ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364754191_Passionate_Friendship_The_Aesthetics_of_Girl's_Culture_in_Japan"]. Since the 1970s, shōjo manga has included themes of romance between adolescent boys, a genre known as shōnen ai, which has been popular with female readers ["https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:702213/s4248771_final_thesis.pdf"]. While shounen manga often attracts a large female audience, shōjo manga is consumed primarily within a female space ["https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1m2x276/why_shoujo_struggles_with_male_audiences_and_what/"].

Academic research, particularly within queer, fan, and cultural studies, analyzes this genre and related ones like Boys' Love (BL) to understand how audiences interpret their unconventional representations of gender ["https://journals.publishing.umich.edu/gs/article/7383/galley/5673/view/", "https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5899&context=gc_etds"]. These queer readings have provided a more nuanced understanding of the material, shifting away from earlier studies that focused primarily on heterosexual female fans ["https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5899&context=gc_etds"].

However, the available information does not contain specific details about how the consumption of shōjo manga affects the pronoun use or sentence-ending particles of queer young adults in Japan.

Search Query: sociolinguistic analysis of "yakuwarigo" in BL manga and its application to queer identity and gender performativity in Japan
Search Answer: The concept of "yakuwarigo," or "role language," is central to understanding stylized speech in Japanese mass media. The term was introduced by Satoshi Kinsui in 2000 and further defined in his 2003 publication, "Vaacharu nihonngo yakuwarigo no nazo" [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288873219_Role_Language_and_Character_Language, https://www.scribd.com/document/680543560/645347].

Yakuwarigo is described as systems of stylized character idiolects that are commonly found in media like anime and manga [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376793168_To_SubServe_Man_Role_Language_and_Intimate_Scripts_in_Kioku_no_Dizorubu]. The concept examines the relationship between this fictionalized speech used to define character roles and real-world language use [https://ssj.iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp/archives/announcement/].

While yakuwarigo provides a framework for analyzing how characters speak in media, the provided information does not contain a sociolinguistic analysis of its specific influence on the queer community in Japan. There is no information regarding how the consumption of shoujo manga might affect the pronoun use or sentence-ending particles of queer young adults, nor on its broader influence on queer identity and gender performativity.

Search Query: academic analysis of the tension between BL manga's linguistic stereotypes (yakuwarigo) and the real-world language use (lived language) of the Japanese queer community
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, the concept of *yakuwarigo* is central to understanding language use in Japanese fictional media. Coined by Satoshi Kinsui in 2003, *yakuwarigo*, or "role language," refers to the spoken language and linguistic stereotypes used by characters in Japanese works of fiction, including novels, comics, and animation [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356712258_Yakuwarigo_and_Linguistic_Stereotype_in_Japanese_Fiction_Linguistic_Stereotype_phenomenon_in_Japanese_Novel_Comics_and_Animation, https://repository.widyatama.ac.id/items/a3de9c13-199e-4717-a20c-92d4628daf92].

Academic research has applied the concept of *yakuwarigo* to analyze shōjo manga, specifically in studies of first-person expressions, such as pronouns, used by teenage girl characters [https://silvajp.web.amu.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Silva-Iaponicarum-64-65.pdf].

However, the provided sources do not contain a direct analysis of how the consumption of shōjo or BL (Boys' Love) manga influences the real-world language of the queer community in Japan. There is no specific information on the tension between these fictional linguistic stereotypes and the actual pronoun use and sentence-ending particles of queer Japanese young adults.

Search Query: distinguishing correlation from causation in media influence on linguistic identity construction in Japanese queer communities
Search Answer: Based on the research, a direct causal link between the consumption of shoujo manga and the specific pronoun and sentence-ending particle usage of queer Japanese young adults has not been established. The available information points to a more complex, correlational relationship where mass media both reflects and reinforces existing linguistic styles within the community.

The central concept connecting media and language here is *yakuwarigo*, or "role language," which is prevalent in fictional media like manga. Shoujo manga, in particular, utilizes *yakuwarigo* to construct stereotypically feminine characters. This includes the use of first-person pronouns like *atashi* and *uchi* and sentence-final particles such as *wa*, *wa yo*, *no yo*, and *kashira*.

This feminine-coded language found in manga is very similar to *onee kotoba* ("gay male speech style"). This alignment suggests a strong correlation, but the direction of influence is unclear—a "chicken and egg" problem. Some research indicates that manga may be reflecting a speech style already associated with parts of the queer community rather than creating it. For example, the language used by *otokonoko* ("male daughters") characters in manga and anime closely mirrors *onee kotoba*, suggesting the media is drawing from an existing linguistic style.

However, individuals may also draw upon these media-based linguistic styles as a resource for performing and expressing their identity. A case study of a 22-year-old gay Japanese man found that he consciously used feminine pronouns and sentence-final particles characteristic of *yakuwarigo*.

Furthermore, shoujo manga is not the only media source influencing these speech patterns. The widespread recognition and popularization of *onee kotoba* is more frequently attributed to its use by gay male and transgender television personalities and comedians. This broader media exposure influenced public perception and was, in turn, adopted by some LGBTQ+ individuals.

In conclusion, while the gendered language in shoujo manga aligns with speech patterns observed in some members of the Japanese queer community, the data only supports a correlation. It shows that fictional "role language" from various media sources is a resource for identity construction, but it does not prove that shoujo manga specifically causes these linguistic choices.

Search Query: influence of Japanese TV personalities on the popularization and stereotypes of "onee kotoba"
Search Answer: Japanese TV personalities have influenced the popularization of "onee kotoba," a linguistic style that has become more widely diffused in Japanese culture [https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1075/pbns.263.05ch5/html?srsltid=AfmBOoohSoZxJgZCyqeEGIHFGPBzn2A4eeOBP2ROHnBIUgXs5ALSXpGh].

The TV personality Matsuko Deluxe, for example, is noted for using onee kotoba by combining vulgar forms with stereotypical "women's speech" [https://wesleycrobertson.wordpress.com/2021/05/14/reflections-on-designing-a-japanese-sociolinguistics-course/].

The style is associated with individuals who present femininely, often called "onee" [https://www.tumblr.com/satans-tiddies/182756539866/bl-okama-and-gay-stereotypes-in-animanga].

Search Query: discourse analysis of language use in Japanese BL fandom online spaces social media
Search Answer: Academic research has been conducted to analyze the online discourse within Japanese BL (Boys' Love) fandom spaces, particularly as the genre diversifies and breaks with older conventions ["https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5899&context=gc_etds"]. Studies have examined Japanese online discourse on specific social media platforms like Twitter ["http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1331873"], and analysis of user interactions on platforms such as Bilibili offers linguistic insights into how social media shapes these interactions ["https://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/1939/2805"]. Other related research analyzes how Japanese society publicizes and perceives cultural works centered on same-sex romance ["https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2024.2361042"].

However, while these sources confirm that research on these topics exists, they do not contain the specific findings of the discourse analyses, such as details on pronoun use or sentence-ending particles within these communities ["https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5899&context=gc_etds", "http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1331873", "https://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/1939/2805"].

Search Query: comparative analysis of sociolinguistic theories on media influence versus subcultural identity formation in minority language use
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, there is no direct research available on the specific influence of shoujo manga on the pronoun use and sentence-ending particles of queer young adults in Japan. The sources do not contain a comparative analysis of sociolinguistic theories regarding media influence versus subcultural identity formation within this specific context.

However, the research does offer a broader sociolinguistic framework that suggests media influence and subcultural identity formation are interconnected rather than opposing forces.

*   **Language as a Tool for Identity:** Language, particularly on social media, is seen as a "performative and strategic resource" that individuals use to construct identities, express emotions, and align with social groups. The specific features and cultures of different media platforms—their "platform-specific affordances"—play a direct role in shaping these language and identity practices [https://jalt.com.pk/index.php/jalt/article/download/703/548/1258].

*   **Building Virtual Communities:** A study of a bilingual community on Instagram illustrates this dynamic. It found that users engaged in practices like code-mixing, cross-linguistic humor, and using emojis to construct their identities and reinforce a sense of belonging within a virtual community. This supports the theory of "translanguaging," which views language as a practical tool. The interactive nature of social media allows users to shift between different language modes to express themselves and solidify their connection to a group [https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2025/13/shsconf_icepcc2025_01019.pdf].

While these findings highlight how media facilitates identity construction through language in online communities, they do not specifically address the communities or media mentioned in your query.

Search Query: linguistic ethnography of Japanese queer online communities (Twitter, Pixiv) focusing on adoption or rejection of BL manga's seme/uke yakuwarigo
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, there are no specific ethnographic studies available that investigate whether queer Japanese young adults adopt or reject the pronoun and sentence-ending particle patterns found in shoujo or Boys' Love (BL) manga.

However, existing research does offer insights into how linguistic styles from BL manga are adopted by a different demographic: heterosexual female fans, known as *fujoshi*. This research highlights the following points:

*   **"BL-style speech" (*BL fū kuchō*):** *Fujoshi* have been observed adopting a specific linguistic style from BL manga in their online communities. This is used as a form of identity play to signal their status as fans [1, 9].
*   ***Yakuwarigo* (Role Language):** The language in BL manga relies heavily on *yakuwarigo*, or stereotyped speech styles associated with specific character roles. The primary roles are the *seme* (dominant) and *uke* (submissive) characters, each with a distinct way of speaking that is central to their characterization [4].
*   **Gender-Incongruent Particle Use:** A key feature of "BL-style speech" is the use of stereotypically feminine sentence-final particles, such as *wa* and *wa yo*, by male characters, particularly the *uke* [1, 9].
*   **Function in Fan Communities:** When *fujoshi* adopt this gender-incongruent language online, it is understood within the community as a playful quotation of fictional language. It serves to perform and index their identity as BL fans rather than to reflect their own gender identity [1, 9].

In summary, while the influence of media on language use is evident in fan communities like *fujoshi*, the provided research does not contain the specific information needed to determine how queer Japanese young adults engage with these linguistic styles in their personal expression.

Search Query: comparative linguistic analysis of "BL fū kuchō" (BL-style speech) use by fujoshi versus Japanese queer community members (tōjisha)
Search Answer: Based on the provided research, the consumption of Boys' Love (BL) manga, a subgenre of shoujo, influences the language of its fan community rather than the Japanese queer community it depicts. The linguistic phenomenon is known as "BL fū kuchō" (BL-style speech), a form of "yakuwarigo" (role language) adopted primarily by heterosexual female fans known as "fujoshi."

**"BL-Style Speech" as a Fan-Based Phenomenon**

"BL fū kuchō" involves mimicking the speech patterns of characters in BL fiction. Fujoshi adopt this style, especially in online communications, to express their fan identity and create a sense of community. This speech is a performative "virtual dialect" and is not reflective of the language used by the queer community (tōjisha).

The linguistic features of this style are drawn from the stereotypical character roles in BL media, incorporating masculine first-person pronouns like `ore` and `boku` and sentence-final particles such as `ze`, `daze`, and `daro`. Some analyses also note the use of stereotypically feminine sentence-ending particles like `wa`, `yo`, `no`, and `kashira`, likely reflecting the language of different character archetypes within the genre.

**Contrast with the Language of the Queer Community**

Research and reports from queer community members, particularly gay men, indicate that they rarely, if ever, use "BL-style speech" in their daily lives. Linguistic analysis reveals distinct differences between the speech of gay men and the "BL fū kuchō" used by fans:

*   **First-Person Pronouns**: One study found that gay men used masculine first-person pronouns (`boku` and `ore`) in 91.4% of instances, whereas BL fans using the style did so only 41.7% of the time.
*   **Sentence-Final Particles**: Conversely, BL fans used sentence-final particles associated with the genre (`ze`, `daze`, `daro`) more frequently than gay men did.

This data suggests that the speech of gay men is not "BL-like." "BL fū kuchō" is further distinguished from "onee kotoba," a stereotypical speech style associated with some real-life gay men. While "onee kotoba" is connected to the language of actual sexual minorities, "BL fū kuchō" is a more recent phenomenon originating from fictional media and is primarily confined to the fan community.

In conclusion, the distinct pronoun and particle use found in BL manga does not appear to be adopted by queer young adults in Japan. Instead, it has fostered a unique "role language" used by the fujoshi fanbase, which remains separate from the authentic linguistic expression of the queer community.

Search Query: analysis of yakuwarigo as identity performance for insider (tōjisha) vs outsider (fujoshi) communities in Japan
Search Answer: Yakuwarigo (役割語), translated as "role language," is a linguistic style frequently used in Japanese fiction, including manga, anime, and novels, to convey specific traits about a character, such as their age, gender, and social class [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuwarigo, https://docslib.org/doc/12759973/modern-japanese-role-language-yakuwarigo, https://www.jardcs.org/abstract.php?id=879]. Coined by Satoshi Kinsui in 2003, this device is a vital tool in character creation, linking a character's speech style to their social identity and background, which allows the audience to quickly recognize their traits [https://www.jardcs.org/abstract.php?id=879, https://filmlifestyle.com/yakuwarigo-character-identity-in-writing/]. Yakuwarigo functions as a form of linguistic stereotype, applying common social stereotypes to fictional characters to make them more easily identifiable based on how they talk [https://www.jardcs.org/abstract.php?id=879].

Academic research into this concept includes analyses relevant to your query, such as studies on "First Person Expressions Used by Teenage Girl Characters in Shōjo Manga" [https://silvajp.web.amu.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Silva-Iaponicarum-64-65.pdf]. However, the provided information does not contain a specific analysis of how the consumption of shoujo manga and its use of yakuwarigo affects the pronoun use and sentence-ending particles of the queer community in Japan. The search results lack information regarding identity performance and language use for insider (tōjisha) versus outsider (fujoshi) communities.

Search Query: application of gender performativity theory to "BL fū kuchō" and identity play in fujoshi online communities
Search Answer: While research on the broader queer community is not detailed in the provided answers, a specific phenomenon known as "BL fū kuchō" (BL-style parlance) offers insight into how media consumption affects gendered language use within a related subculture: fujoshi, or female fans of Boys' Love (BL) media. This linguistic practice is primarily observed in online fan communities and is analyzed through the lens of gender performativity.

"BL fū kuchō" is a speech style where fans adopt stereotypically masculine linguistic features found in the BL manga they consume. This includes using masculine first-person pronouns like "ore" and "boku" and sentence-final particles such as "ze," "daze," and "~da." This practice is a form of "yakuwarigo" (role language) or "kyarakuchi" (character-speak), where users adopt the speech patterns of fictional characters to engage in identity play or role-play ("nari-kiri").

According to gender performativity theory, influenced by Judith Butler, gender is not an innate quality but is constructed through the "stylized repetition of acts," including speech. By consciously adopting masculine linguistic forms, fujoshi engage in a performative act of "playing with gender." This allows them to perform a temporary, context-dependent boyish or androgynous persona within their fan community.

This linguistic performance serves several functions. It allows fans to explore non-hegemonic masculinities and engage in a "disidentification with heteronormative femininity," thereby challenging the notion of gender as a stable, internal identity. This shared discursive strategy also helps construct a distinct in-group identity for fujoshi online. The practice is part of a broader engagement by "performative fans" who apply "queer readings" to media, which in turn informs their own performances of gender and identity.

Search Query: case studies of linguistic innovation and identity construction in global queer communities influenced by niche media
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, there are no specific case studies on how niche media, like shoujo manga, influences linguistic innovation and identity construction within the queer community in Japan.

The available sources do not address the specific impact of manga on the use of pronouns or sentence-ending particles by queer Japanese young adults. Instead, the research touches upon related but distinct topics, such as:
*   Queer linguistics and identity in general terms.
*   The influence of new media, such as BookTok, on identity and language among international users.
*   Case studies of language in other minoritized queer communities, specifically in Europe (including Irish, Breton, Catalan, and Welsh speakers) and the LGBTQ+ movement in Chicago.

Ultimately, the specific intersection of shoujo manga, queer Japanese speakers, and their linguistic practices is not covered in the provided materials.

Search Query: academic analysis of Japanese queer community (tōjisha) critique of BL manga's linguistic stereotypes (yakuwarigo) as inauthentic
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, an academic analysis of how shoujo manga consumption affects the language use of queer young adults in Japan is not available.

The sources do, however, introduce the concept of *yakuwarigo*, which is a type of stereotypical "role language" used in Japanese fiction to portray a character's traits, including their gender and age, through distinct speech patterns. Examples of gendered *yakuwarigo* relevant to your query include:
*   **Pronouns:** the masculine おれ (ore), the boyish ぼく (boku), and the feminine あたし (atashi).
*   **Sentence-ending particles:** the feminine particle わ (wa).

The term *tōjisha* is also mentioned in reference to the queer community, particularly in the context of debates surrounding sexual minority rights in Japan.

While the concepts of *yakuwarigo* (linguistic stereotypes in fiction) and *tōjisha* (the queer community) are present in the source material, the information does not connect them. There is no analysis of the queer community's critique of these linguistic stereotypes in manga or how such media influences their personal expression.

Search Query: application of queer theory and gender performativity to linguistic identity construction by Japanese sexual minorities (tōjisha)
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, there is no direct evidence regarding the influence of shoujo manga on pronoun use or sentence-ending particles among queer young adults in Japan. However, academic work does explore how Japanese sexual minorities construct their identities through distinct linguistic practices [https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-30_61cdc9d64808c_QueerJapaneseGenderandSexualIdentitiesthroughLinguisticPracticesbyHidekoAbez-lib.org_.pdf, https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Queer-Japanese%3A-Gender-and-Sexual-Identities-Abe/851617ccb00645d5ebbcb3280f157cbb4c2adfd9].

Key linguistic practices within queer communities in Japan include:
*   **"O-nē-kotoba" (queen's speech)** This is a notable speech style that can function as a common language to build communal solidarity, particularly in settings like gay bars. It is also used for "dokuzetsu" (sharp-tongued criticism) and can be subject to imitation and negative associations [https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-30_61cdc9d64808c_QueerJapaneseGenderandSexualIdentitiesthroughLinguisticPracticesbyHidekoAbez-lib.org_.pdf].
*   **Identity-specific terminology** The construction of identity also involves the use of specific terms such as "o-kama," "o-nabe," and "nyū-hāfu" (new half). The term "o-nabe" is related to "dansō" (female-to-male crossdressing) [https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-30_61cdc9d64808c_QueerJapaneseGenderandSexualIdentitiesthroughLinguisticPracticesbyHidekoAbez-lib.org_.pdf, https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Queer-Japanese%3A-Gender-and-Sexual-Identities-Abe/851617ccb00645d5ebbcb3280f157cbb4c2adfd9].

Search Query: Japanese queer community (tōjisha) perceptions of "BL fū kuchō" and yakuwarigo as inauthentic fan language
Search Answer: Based on research into the influence of Boys' Love (BL) media on the language of Japan's queer community, the linguistic style known as "BL fū kuchō" (BL-style speech) is widely perceived by community members as an inauthentic fan language rather than a reflection of their own speech patterns [1, 2, 5]. This style is a form of *yakuwarigo*, or "role language," which uses linguistic stereotypes, such as specific pronouns and sentence-final particles, to construct a character's persona for a fictional narrative [3, 6].

The linguistic features of "BL fū kuchō" often involve assigning feminine sentence-final particles like `wa`, `no`, and `kashira` and first-person pronouns such as `atashi` to the *uke* (receiving or "bottom") character in a relationship [1, 5, 6]. This constructed language is seen as a fictionalized stereotype, as it is primarily created by and for a heterosexual female audience and does not represent how queer individuals, particularly gay men, actually speak [1, 3, 6].

Members of the Japanese queer community (`tōjisha`) often express a sense of discomfort or wrongness ("iwakan") toward this language, with some describing it as "kimochi warui" (creepy or gross) [1, 2]. One gay man characterized the language in BL media as "somewhat feminine and affected," labeling it a "fantasy" and noting that he and his gay friends do not use particles like `wa` and `kashira` in their daily lives [5]. Because BL is viewed as a fantasy genre "by women, for women," its unrealistic dialogue is seen as an artificial element that contributes to feelings of alienation and misrepresentation within the queer community [1, 2, 5].

While this media-constructed speech can overlap with other stereotypes like *onee-kotoba* (effeminate gay male speech), both are largely seen as media constructions distinct from authentic queer communication [1, 5]. Academic research supports the community's view, indicating that the feminized speech attributed to gay men in media is a stereotype not representative of their actual language use [2, 3]. Although some queer individuals might use these linguistic stereotypes ironically or performatively, they are not considered an authentic part of the community's everyday language [1, 5].

Search Query: linguistic analysis of ballroom culture lexicon (e.g., 'shade', 'reading') as queer identity performance and its popularization through media
Search Answer: The lexicon of ballroom culture, which was created by Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) members to form an inclusive and unique queer space, has had a significant linguistic impact on both the broader LGBTQ+ community and mainstream pop culture [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370717338_Ballroom_Culture, https://medium.com/@vitdebsoc/the-vibrant-impact-of-queer-language-on-pop-culture-71200e9af176]. The vernacular from ballroom provides a way to modify and explore language for enhanced inclusivity [https://glreview.org/the-language-of-ballroom/].

Two examples of this influence include:
*   **"Reading,"** which is defined within queer cultures as the act of delivering playful, witty, and sometimes sassy criticism or teasing [https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/queercultures101/2023/11/05/reading-shade/].
*   **"Mother/Mothering,"** a term of reverence that originated in ballroom culture and has since been popularized as widespread queer slang on the internet [https://www.out.com/news/queer-slang-2025].

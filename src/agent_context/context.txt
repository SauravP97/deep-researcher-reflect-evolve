Search Query: impact of ENSO PDO sea surface temperature and upwelling on pelagic fish stock dynamics
Search Answer: The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts pelagic fish stocks by altering marine environments and ocean conditions [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280587989_The_impact_of_El_Nino_events_on_the_pelagic_food_chain_in_the_northern_California_Current, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10376808/]. Strong El Niño events, in particular, are associated with warming sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and reduced upwelling along the equatorial and eastern Pacific. For example, the strong events in 1982–1983 and 1997–1998 led to declines in upwelling-favorable winds in the Northern California Current [https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/6395w891m].

More broadly, ENSO events affect sea levels, primary productivity, and ocean circulation, which can create cascading effects throughout the pelagic food chain [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10376808/, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280587989_The_impact_of_El_Nino_events_on_the_pelagic_food_chain_in_the_northern_California_Current]. In the South China Sea, for instance, ENSO influences sea levels, surface temperatures, ocean circulation, and the primary productivity that underpins the marine food web [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10376808/].

Furthermore, ENSO can have indirect consequences for fisheries through its impact on tropical cyclones, storms, and floods, which can cause damage to infrastructure and affect safety at sea [https://hal.science/hal-03411921/document]. The effects of ENSO on marine capture fisheries are assessed on both global and regional scales, with specific analyses for major fishing areas in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans [https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/e6c87962-c4f7-443c-b9e3-57d94e7c0470/content].

Search Query: fishery economics definitions of "landings" "catch per unit effort (CPUE)" "price elasticity" and "ex-vessel price"
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, the following definitions of key fishery economic terms are available. The materials do not contain specific research on the price dynamics of chub mackerel in Pacific Rim countries.

*   **Catch per unit effort (CPUE)**: The provided sources offer two distinct definitions for this term.
    *   One definition describes it as the number of fish caught for a given amount of fishing effort.
    *   Another definition refers to a value calculated by multiplying the volume of the retained catch by the ex-vessel price per unit.
    *   One study also notes that a measure of CPUE can be constructed using the characteristics of the fishing vessel and firm.

*   **Ex-vessel price**: This is the price that fishermen or dealers receive for fish when it is sold. For example, a January 2025 report on Gulf of America Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) pricing indicated that the average ex-vessel price for Red Grouper was $6.61.

The provided search results do not contain definitions for the terms "landings" or "price elasticity."

Search Query: fisheries economics definition of "landings" AND "price elasticity"
Search Answer: In fisheries economics, price elasticity (ep) is a concept used to address the issue of non-constant prices for landings [https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/ewemodel/chapter/price-elasticity/]. The quantity of landings can influence the price elasticity function; for example, anchovy landings from a specific seiner fleet can be a primary driver [https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/ewemodel/chapter/tutorial-price-elasticity/]. Price elasticity is also analyzed in relation to fish harvest rates and annual landings [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5699034/]. Another related concept is cross-price elasticity, which can be unitary or elastic [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42629099].

The provided information does not contain a formal definition for the term "landings," but it is used in various contexts, such as "landings patterns" [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42629099], "annual landings" [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5699034/], and the ratio between small landings and total landings [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/47873/noaa_47873_DS1.pdf].

Search Query: FAO fisheries glossary definition of "landings"
Search Answer: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, "landings" refers to the portion of a fish catch that is physically brought to shore at a designated landing site ["https://www.fao.org/4/a0231e/A0231E09.htm", "https://www.fao.org/4/x8923e/X8923E03.htm", "https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/education/voicesofthebay/glossary.html"]. The weight of what is brought to land is also referred to as landings ["https://www.fao.org/4/a0231e/A0231E09.htm"].

This term is distinct from the total "catch," which also includes fish that are discarded at sea ["https://www.fao.org/4/a0231e/A0231E09.htm"]. Fisheries management can involve limiting landings through methods such as total allowable catch (TAC) and quotas ["https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781444316315.gloss"].

Search Query: fisheries economics textbook glossary definition "price elasticity"
Search Answer: Price elasticity of demand is defined as the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price [https://studylib.net/doc/8039933/chapter-4-%E2%80%93-elasticity---mba-program-resources]. It can also be described as the percentage change in quantity demanded that is caused by a one percent change in the price [https://verso.uidaho.edu/view/pdfCoverPage?instCode=01ALLIANCE_UID&filePid=13341557380001851&download=true], or the response of sales to a 1% reduction or increase in its price [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/price-elasticity].

In a fisheries context, this could represent the percentage change in the quantity of fishing trips demanded resulting from a 1% change in the price per trip [https://verso.uidaho.edu/view/pdfCoverPage?instCode=01ALLIANCE_UID&filePid=13341557380001851&download=true]. Price elasticity of demand is the inverse of price flexibility [https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/232953/files/us-fisheries-interior-22.pdf]. This type of elasticity is typically high, with one source stating an average of -1.8 [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/price-elasticity].

### Fishery Dynamics and Catch Volumes

The chub mackerel fishery off the coast of the Baja California peninsula is characterized as intermittent and sporadic. Catch volumes have shown significant fluctuation over the decades.

*   **Historical Catches:** The historical maximum catch in the Pacific occurred in 1981 with 230,000 tons. Other notable peaks in landings were recorded in 1987, 1996, and 1997.
*   **21st Century Fluctuations:** In more recent years, catches have varied widely. For example, a low of 13,016 tons was recorded in 2005, followed by a peak of 64,183 tons in 2011. Subsequent annual catches were 36,589 tons (2012), 22,333 tons (2013), 17,468 tons (2014), 23,028 tons (2015), and 48,469 tons (2016). Reflecting the fishery's sporadic nature, the catch for the 2017-2018 season was only 1,180 tons.
*   **Recent Proportions:** As part of the broader small pelagics fishery off the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula, chub mackerel constituted 13% of the total 208,007 tons caught in 2018, and 4% of the 299,618 tons caught in 2021.

The main fishing areas are along the west coast of the Baja California peninsula and in the Gulf of California, with key fleets based in Ensenada, Baja California, and Puerto Adolfo López Mateos, Baja California Sur. The primary fishing season generally runs from spring to autumn, with peaks occurring between April and November.

### Interannual and Regional Variations in Weight and Length

Biological data collected from various regions and seasons reveal significant variations in the size of caught mackerel.

*   **Length:**
    *   **Observed Range:** Across multiple studies, the length of captured mackerel typically ranges from 120 mm to 360 mm.
    *   **Averages and Modes:** Different reports indicate varying average sizes, suggesting interannual or regional differences. Averages have been reported between 275 mm and 285 mm, with another study noting a modal size of 250 mm. In the 2017-2018 season, the average length was smaller, at 210 mm.
    *   **Maximum Size:** While the species is commonly found up to 30 cm (300 mm) and can reach a maximum length of 50-60 cm globally, the maximum recorded length in the Mexican fishery is 420 mm.
    *   **Maturity:** The species typically reaches sexual maturity at a length of 250 mm.

*   **Weight:**
    *   **General Averages:** The average weight is reported to be around 300 grams, with a maximum recorded weight of 1,100 grams.
    *   **Regional Variations:** Specific studies show a strong correlation between location, fish length, and weight. In Bahía Magdalena, where smaller individuals were sampled (122-266 mm), weights ranged from 15 to 191 grams. In the Gulf of California, where larger fish were caught (130-360 mm), weights ranged from 30 to 650 grams.

### Reproductive Biology and Fishery Management

Reproductive cycles also vary by region, a key factor for fishery management.
*   **Spawning Seasons:** Off the Pacific coast of the peninsula, the primary reproductive period occurs from April to August, peaking in June and July. In contrast, spawning in the Gulf of California occurs from November to April (peaking in February-March), and in Bahía Magdalena, it occurs primarily in summer and autumn.
*   **Management:** This biological data, collected through programs like the National Program for the Collection of Information from the Fisheries Sector (PRONARIP), informs management actions such as the implementation of temporary fishing bans to protect the species during key reproductive periods. The fishery is officially diagnosed as being at its maximum sustainable yield.

### Key Findings and Length-Weight Relationship

Across the entire sampling period, the dominant fork length of Chub Mackerel was generally between 230 and 360 mm. The relationship between fork length (L) and body weight (W) was consistently calculated in several NPFC working papers, demonstrating a stable allometric growth pattern. The formulas derived from different datasets are as follows:

*   **2016 (2,168 samples)**: W = 1.05E-05 * L^2.9272
*   **2016-2018 (6,269 samples)**: W = 1.07E-05 * L^2.9234
*   **2016-2019 (7,750 samples)**: W = 1E-05 * L^2.9284
*   **2016-2020 (8,975 samples)**: W = 1E-05 * L^2.923

*   **Growth Rate Formula:** One paper provides the formula for annual growth rates in length (GL) as GL = LA+1 – LA, where LA represents the fish's length at a given age.

Search Query: Fulton's condition factor (K) and relative condition factor (Kn) formula calculation fisheries science
Search Answer: In fisheries science, condition factors are used to assess the well-being of a fish. One common measure is Fulton's condition factor, also referred to as the coefficient of condition factor (K or kc). It is calculated using the formula `kc = 100*W/L3`, where W represents the total weight of the fish and L is its total length [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1687428523000018]. An alternative version of this formula is expressed as `K = [g wet mass/mm TL3] × 106` [https://www.mdpi.com/2410-3888/10/10/521].

Another metric is the relative condition factor (Kn), developed by Le Cren in 1951. It is calculated with the formula `Kn = W/W′` [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Condition-factor-K-and-relative-condition-factor-Kn-for-the-two-fish-species-of_fig4_315088109, https://education.fisheries.org/wp-content/uploads/fisheriesTechniquesVisuals/Chap_15.pdf]. In this equation, W is the weight of an individual fish, and W′ represents the length-specific mean weight of a fish within the population being studied [https://www.mtcfru.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eckelbecker_et_al_2022.pdf]. The value for W′ is derived from the length-weight relationship formula `W' = a * L^b` [https://education.fisheries.org/wp-content/uploads/fisheriesTechniquesVisuals/Chap_15.pdf, https://www.mtcfru.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eckelbecker_et_al_2022.pdf].

Search Query: academic study "Scomber japonicus" condition factor interannual OR temporal variation
Search Answer: Academic research has examined the price dynamics and biological variations of chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) in relation to environmental factors, providing insights into the connections between marine resources, aquatic markets, and the marine environment.

Studies have investigated the interannual variations in the species' biological characteristics, including changes in body condition, cohort-specific growth, and length-at-age. Key factors influencing these variations have been identified as density-dependence and sea surface temperature. For example, one study specifically analyzed the effects of these two factors on the interannual variation in length-at-age for chub mackerel in the Kuroshio-Oyashio area from 1970 to 1997.

Further research connects these biological and environmental changes to fishery economics. Studies have explored the impact of climatic variations on mackerel quality, which has been observed in auction settings. Related research has also examined the year-to-year abundances of chub mackerel larvae, linking environmental conditions to the species' reproductive success and population dynamics.

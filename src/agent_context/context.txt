Search Query: differentiating consumer tablets vs purpose-built enterprise tablets for business applications
Search Answer: Enterprise-grade tablets used for payments and SaaS applications differ significantly from consumer tablets in several key areas, including durability, battery functionality, peripheral support, and total cost of ownership (TCO).

*   **Durability and Design:** Enterprise tablets, such as those manufactured by Zebra and Honeywell, are specifically built for durability in rugged industrial environments. They are designed to withstand drops, spills, and other hazards common in commercial settings. In contrast, consumer tablets are more fragile and prone to breaking under such conditions.
*   **Battery and Power Management:** A critical differentiator is battery performance. Enterprise tablets typically feature longer battery life and hot-swappable options, allowing for continuous, uninterrupted use throughout a workday. Consumer devices, on the other hand, often have shorter battery lives and lack the ability to swap batteries without powering down.
*   **Peripheral and Legacy Support:** Business-focused tablets offer superior support for peripherals and can integrate legacy I/O ports. This enables them to connect with older, specialized equipment and machinery, a feature generally unavailable on consumer-grade models.
*   **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** Although consumer tablets have a lower upfront purchase price, their long-term cost for business deployment is often much higher. One study found that the total cost of deploying and supporting consumer tablets over a five-year period was nearly double that of purpose-built enterprise tablets ($23,000 vs. $12,000). This highlights that the initial savings of consumer devices can be offset by higher maintenance, replacement, and support costs.

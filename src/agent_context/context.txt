### **Design Report: 3D Reconstruction and Phenotypic Analysis of Crop Grains**

#### **1.0 System Modeling and Design: Data Acquisition Modality Selection**

The foundational component of any 3D reconstruction system for grain phenotyping is the data acquisition sensor. The choice of imaging modality directly impacts the accuracy, resolution, speed, and cost of the entire analysis pipeline. Several 3D imaging modalities are suitable for scanning small objects like crop grains, including structured light, laser triangulation, and multi-view stereo (also known as stereo vision or photogrammetry) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391519768_Advancements_and_Challenges_in_3D_Scanning_A_Comprehensive_Review_of_Engineering_Applications, https://www.ml6.eu/en/blog/optical-3d-acquisition-methods-a-comprehensive-guide-part-2].

A comparative analysis of these methods is presented below to inform the design choice.

#### **1.1 Comparison of 3D Imaging Modalities**

**Multi-View Stereo (Stereo Vision)**
*   **Methodology**: As a form of photogrammetry, this is a versatile and cost-effective 3D acquisition method [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391519768_Advancements_and_Challenges_in_3D_Scanning_A_Comprehensive_Review_of_Engineering_Applications, https://www.ml6.eu/en/blog/optical-3d-acquisition-methods-a-comprehensive-guide-part-2]. It is particularly well-suited for applications that require real-time depth information.
*   **Performance**: Stereo vision typically provides higher accuracy and resolution compared to other methods like Time of Flight (ToF). However, its accuracy may be lower than that of structured light systems [https://www.ml6.eu/en/blog/optical-3d-acquisition-methods-a-comprehensive-guide-part-2].

**Structured Light**
*   **Methodology**: This technique captures a 2D image of a deformed light pattern projected onto an object. This captured image is then used to generate a detailed 3D point cloud or depth map that represents the object's surface structure [https://www.ml6.eu/en/blog/optical-3d-acquisition-methods-a-comprehensive-guide-part-2].
*   **Performance**: Structured light systems are known for providing higher accuracy and resolution compared to methods like ToF sensors, making them suitable for capturing fine details on grain surfaces [https://www.ml6.eu/en/blog/optical-3d-acquisition-methods-a-comprehensive-guide-part-2].

**Laser Triangulation**
*   **Methodology**: This technique is considered the optimal solution for high-speed scanning, especially when the target objects are in motion, such as on a conveyor line for high-throughput phenotyping [https://www.automate.org/vision/tech-papers/structured-light-vs-laser-triangulation-for-3d-scanning-and-inspection]. A related method, LiDAR, generates a 3D point cloud using the timing and intensity information from each laser pulse [https://www.ml6.eu/en/blog/optical-3d-acquisition-methods-a-comprehensive-guide-part-2].
*   **Performance**: Its primary advantage is speed, making it the optimal choice for dynamic scanning environments [https://www.automate.org/vision/tech-papers/structured-light-vs-laser-triangulation-for-3d-scanning-and-inspection].

#### **1.2 Summary and Recommendation**

The selection of the optimal modality depends on the specific research priorities:

*   **For High-Throughput Analysis:** **Laser triangulation** is the optimal choice for scanning grains in motion (e.g., on a conveyor belt) due to its superior speed [https://www.automate.org/vision/tech-papers/structured-light-vs-laser-triangulation-for-3d-scanning-and-inspection].
*   **For High-Fidelity Models:** **Structured light** is recommended when the highest accuracy and resolution are required to capture minute surface details, though this may come at the cost of scanning speed.
*   **For Cost-Effective & Real-Time Applications:** **Stereo vision** presents a versatile and economical option, providing a good balance of performance, especially when real-time processing is a consideration [https://www.ml6.eu/en/blog/optical-3d-acquisition-methods-a-comprehensive-guide-part-2].

Search Query: algorithms to compute grain morphometric phenotypes (volume, surface area, sphericity, dimensions) from 3D point cloud and mesh data
Search Answer: For the modeling, analysis, and design of a system for 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, the following framework can be implemented.

The process begins with 3D reconstruction, where a technique such as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is employed to generate a 3D point cloud from images of the grains [https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/3/391]. Once the point cloud is created, analysis can proceed. To isolate individual grains from a larger sample, a watershed algorithm is used for 3D point cloud segmentation [https://esurf.copernicus.org/articles/10/1211/2022/]. For determining the shape of individual grains, G3Point, a semi-automatic and non-destructive method, can be utilized [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025EGUGA..2715463L/abstract].

From the processed point cloud data, algorithms can then calculate crucial morphometric phenotypes, including length, width, thickness, surface area, and volume [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354674020_Cereal_Grain_3D_Point_Cloud_Analysis_Method_For_Shape_Extraction_And_FilledUnfilled_Grain_Identification_Based_On_Structured_Light_Imaging, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35210561/].

To validate the design, the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction can be assessed by computing the Hausdorff distance between the original point cloud data and the resulting 3D mesh model [https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/3/391].

Search Query: state-space model formulation for active vision systems in robotic 3D object scanning and analysis
Search Answer: For the 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, a design report can be structured around an active vision system using a robotic platform. This approach integrates modern control theory for modeling, analysis, and design.

One method involves using an explicitly defined state-space model that incorporates both the state of the robot and the locations of the grains being scanned [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7973267/]. The objective of such an active vision system is to enable a robotic platform to track the grains and accurately reconstruct their poses in a virtual 3D space [https://rovislab.com/papers/Gigi_RAAD_2011.pdf].

A more modern approach, which can be used as an alternative or in conjunction, is a visual servoing-based active vision framework that does not require prior knowledge of the grain's geometry. This method couples Next-Best-View (NBV) planning with visual servo control. It employs a dual-task visual control law that uses a segmented point cloud and a probabilistic occupancy map as inputs to continuously determine the desired camera velocity. This control law directs the camera to simultaneously achieve two objectives:
1.  Maintain its position relative to the grain, keeping it centered in the field of view.
2.  Explore the grain's surface to maximize an NBV objective, ensuring comprehensive data acquisition for real-time 3D reconstruction [https://hal.science/hal-05397812v1/file/2025_ral_misimi.pdf].

These techniques are situated within a broader context of significant advancements in active vision for robotic applications over the last 15 years, as detailed in several surveys on the topic [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364911410755, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220122397_Active_Vision_in_Robotic_Systems_A_Survey_of_Recent_Developments].

Search Query: observability and controllability analysis of state-space models for active vision systems in 3D reconstruction
Search Answer: **Design Report: Modeling, Analysis, and Design for 3D Reconstruction and Phenotypic Analysis of Crop Grains**

**1. Modeling with State-Space Representations**

For the task of 3D reconstruction, state-space models are a pertinent approach from modern control theory. A specific application can be seen in the use of visual state space models (VMamba) within Depth-Visual-Inertial (DVI) Mapping Systems, which have been effectively used for robust indoor 3D reconstruction. This demonstrates a viable modeling framework for capturing the system's dynamics.

**2. System Analysis and Design Principles**

In the analysis and design of such control systems, the canonical form of a state-space model is a significant and fundamental concept. This representation is crucial for various aspects of control theory, including network analysis and control.

**3. Observability and Controllability Considerations**

A critical component of system analysis involves assessing observability and controllability. However, specific details regarding the observability and controllability analysis of state-space models for active vision systems, which would be essential for designing the 3D reconstruction process, are not detailed in the provided materials.

Search Query: derivation of system dynamics and control law for dual-task visual servoing in active 3D reconstruction
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, here is a design report utilizing modern control theory for 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains.

### **Design Report: A Modern Control Theory Framework for 3D Grain Reconstruction**

This report outlines a design approach for the modeling, analysis, and control of a system for 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, incorporating modern control theory, specifically through visual servoing techniques.

#### **1. System Modeling**

The initial step involves modeling the system dynamics. A classical and effective method for modeling the 3D scanning setup is to calibrate the camera and a structured light projector to deduce the rigid motion matrix between the two devices. This establishes the geometric relationship essential for accurate 3D reconstruction.

#### **2. Control System Design and Analysis**

For the control law design, a dual-task visual servoing framework is proposed to manage both the scanning (reconstruction) and handling (positioning) of the grain samples. This approach leverages different visual servoing strategies, including two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and optimized hybrid methods, to overcome the limitations of classical approaches.

A specific and robust control framework for this application involves a multi-robot setup:

*   **Task 1: Object Tracking and Scanning (Eye-in-Hand Configuration):** One robotic manipulator, equipped with an eye-in-hand camera, would be responsible for tracking and scanning the grain. The control system for this robot would utilize an **eye-in-hand visual servoing controller**. To incorporate modern safety and constraint-handling techniques, **Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)** can be integrated into the control law. The CBF ensures that critical constraints are met, such as keeping the grain or its fiducial markers visible within the camera's field of view at all times, preventing loss of tracking during the reconstruction process.

*   **Task 2: Precise Placement (Eye-to-Hand Configuration):** A second robot with an eye-to-hand camera configuration can be used for the precise pick-and-place of individual grains. This is crucial for ensuring stability and correct positioning of the sample before and after scanning.

#### **3. Addressing System Challenges**

A critical aspect of the design is ensuring robustness to real-world conditions. The control system must be designed to handle measurement disturbances, such as the potential for **target occlusion**. This is a common issue in 3D visual servoing for mobile robots and is equally relevant in the context of manipulating small, potentially irregularly shaped objects like crop grains.

While these documents outline a robust framework combining different visual servoing techniques and modern control methods like CBFs, they do not provide a specific, detailed derivation of the system dynamics or control laws for the dual-task of active 3D reconstruction. However, they offer a strong conceptual basis for developing such a system.

Search Query: mathematical analysis of observability and controllability for image-based visual servoing systems
Search Answer: For a design report on 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, modern control theory can be applied through the framework of image-based visual servoing. This is a control technique where data from a vision sensor, such as a camera, serves as the input to a control loop [https://open.clemson.edu/context/all_theses/article/4446/viewcontent/Allen_clemson_0050M_16045.pdf].

The modeling, analysis, and design of such a system involve the following principles:

*   **System Modeling and Control Law:** In the classic image-based visual servoing framework, control is achieved by directly computing error signals from image feature parameters [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364908096706]. The controlled output is the vector of these features within the image plane. The error signal, which drives the control law, is also defined within this task space [http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/deluca/rob2_en/17_VisualServoing.pdf].

*   **Controllability and Observability Analysis:** The analysis of the system can be approached through the fundamental concepts of controllability and observability.
    *   **Controllability** pertains to the ability to drive the system to a desired state. In this context, the controlled output is the vector of features in the image plane, and the error defined in this space drives the control law [http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/deluca/rob2_en/17_VisualServoing.pdf].
    *   **Observability** relates to the ability to determine the internal state of the system from its external outputs. For visual servoing, one approach interprets feature depth (Z) as an unmeasurable state. This depth must be "observed" and made available to the control system to execute the servoing task [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220121980_Feature_Depth_Observation_for_Image-based_Visual_Servoing_Theory_and_Experiments].

*   **Design Framework:** The mathematical analysis and design for these systems often employ rigorous methods from nonlinear control theory, which provides the tools to handle the complex dynamics inherent in visual servoing tasks [https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=edt].

Search Query: nonlinear observability and controllability analysis for visual servoing systems using Lie derivatives and the image Jacobian matrix
Search Answer: For nonlinear systems, such as those encountered in visual servoing for 3D reconstruction, a differential geometry approach utilizing Lie derivatives is employed for observability and controllability analysis [https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/8/11/1876]. This methodology involves constructing an observability matrix for the nonlinear system based on these Lie derivatives [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338805605_Nonlinear_Observability_Analysis, https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4459003/observability-of-non-linear-system-using-lie-derivative].

The observability matrix is defined as the Jacobian of the observability map, and its rows are composed of the gradients of the Lie derivatives [https://www.roebenack.de/observability]. Performing this analysis is a critical preliminary step in the design process, informing the development of components like an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and aiding in the determination of optimal sensor layout [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4459003/observability-of-non-linear-system-using-lie-derivative]. To facilitate this complex computation, efficient methods, such as those using automatic differentiation, have been developed to compute both the Lie derivatives and the observability matrix [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318039789_An_efficient_method_to_compute_Lie_derivatives_and_the_observability_matrix_for_nonlinear_systems].

Search Query: design of visual servoing controller integrating Next-Best-View planning with Control Barrier Functions for field-of-view safety constraints
Search Answer: Visual Servoing (VS) is a control method that utilizes vision as a perception tool to compute robot control inputs from visual feedback in real-time [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel8/3516/4785241/11173962.pdf]. A significant challenge in this area is managing view constraints, such as the camera's limited field-of-view (FOV), particularly when tracking dynamic targets [https://www.mdpi.com/2218-6581/14/12/190, https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10209946/1/ICARM25_0172_FI.pdf].

To address this, modern control theory offers powerful tools. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective method for enforcing safety constraints and certifying the safety of feedback controllers [https://mit-realm.github.io/nerf-cbf/, https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/IROS25/program/IROS25_ContentListWeb_1.html]. For the specific task of managing FOV limitations in image-based visual servoing, a novel control method that incorporates dual constraints can be implemented to ensure the target remains within the camera's view [https://www.mdpi.com/2218-6581/14/12/190].

Search Query: application of Kalman Filters or Particle Filters for real-time estimation of object geometric features in active vision 3D reconstruction
Search Answer: For the tasks of modeling, analysis, and design in 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, methods from modern control theory can be applied to object tracking, which is essential for assembling a complete 3D model from multiple images.

**State Estimation for 3D Object Tracking**

Key techniques for vision-based tracking include Kalman filters and particle filters. These methods are adept at estimating the state of a dynamic system based on a series of measurements that may be noisy and incomplete.

*   **Kalman Filters:** The Kalman filter is a powerful tool for 3D object tracking [1]. In vision tracking applications, it is particularly useful for managing challenges such as minor or small occlusions [2]. For real-time phenotypic analysis, a tracking system can be implemented by combining the Kalman filter with feature matching techniques. One such system pairs it with Multi-scale Block Local Binary Patterns (MB-LBP) to create a real-time visual object tracking system [3].

*   **Particle Filters:** As an alternative, particle filtering offers another robust approach. This method can be combined with other techniques, such as geometric active contours, for effective object tracking, providing flexibility for different dynamic models or noise characteristics [4].

Search Query: MATLAB/Simulink tutorial for simulating a visual servoing system for high-throughput 3D object inspection or sorting
Search Answer: For your research in 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, a design report can be developed by integrating modeling, analysis, and control theory using MATLAB and Simulink as the primary environment. This framework centers on a visual servoing system for automated 3D object inspection, analysis, and sorting.

### **1. System-Level Modeling and Simulation**

The foundational step is to create a complete simulation of the physical system. A conveyor and robotic sorting system model serves as an excellent testbed for developing and validating algorithms before hardware implementation. A complete model and simulation designed in MATLAB/Simulink for such a system is available and can be adapted for crop grain analysis. This provides a virtual environment to test the entire workflow, from imaging to sorting.

### **2. Visual System for Inspection and Phenotypic Analysis**

The core of phenotypic analysis is the visual inspection component, which can be developed using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques.

*   **Automated Visual Inspection:** MATLAB's Computer Vision Toolbox™ offers an Automated Visual Inspection Library. This can be used to develop deep learning-based systems to detect and localize anomalies or specific phenotypic traits on crop grains.
*   **Deep Learning Workflow:** For implementing this, specific apps within MATLAB are highly useful. The **'Registration Estimator'** app can be used to register and align misaligned images of grains, ensuring consistent analysis. Following this, the **'Deep Network Designer'** app allows for building, visualizing, and training custom deep learning networks. For instance, an object detection model like YOLOX can be trained to find small anomalies or features characteristic of specific phenotypes.

### **3. Control System Design using Visual Feedback**

Modern control theory can be applied through a vision-based control (visual servoing) approach, where the robotic manipulator's actions are guided by real-time visual data.

*   **Vision-Based Control Implementation:** The Machine Vision Toolbox (MVTB) is a critical resource, providing a wide array of functions specifically designed for developing vision-based control systems. This toolbox facilitates the integration of image data into the control loop of the robotic system.
*   **Feedback Control Systems:** The overall control architecture can be designed and simulated as either an open- or closed-loop feedback control system. MathWorks provides numerous tutorials that cover the fundamental principles and practical steps for designing and simulating these control algorithms for robotics applications.

### **4. 3D Manipulation and Visualization**

To address the 3D reconstruction and manipulation aspects of your research, the physical interaction between the robotic system and the crop grains must be modeled and visualized. A Simulink example demonstrates how to configure a model for a 3D shape tracing manipulator. This can be adapted to model the task of picking, reorienting, or tracing the surface of a grain for full 3D reconstruction. The performance of this manipulator can be visualized in a virtual 3D environment using Simulink 3D Animation, providing crucial insights into the system's dynamic performance and accuracy.

Search Query: derivation of state-space model for visual servoing incorporating image Jacobian for nonlinear observability analysis using Lie derivatives
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, while the search results mention relevant concepts such as Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) and the image Jacobian, they do not contain the specific theoretical details necessary to construct the requested design report.

The sources discuss applications of visual servoing in contexts like controlling a 3-DOF robot and a visual servoing approach for space manipulators capturing satellite docking rings [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251919514_Image_Base_Visual_Servoing_Estimation_of_the_image_Jacobian_by_using_lines_in_a_stereo_vision_system, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1000936124001961].

Search Query: state-space model formulation for image-based visual servoing using the image Jacobian interaction matrix
Search Answer: For the tasks of modeling, analysis, and design related to the 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, a control system based on image-based visual servoing (IBVS) is highly applicable. The core of a traditional IBVS control scheme is the image Jacobian, also known as the interaction or feature Jacobian matrix, which relates changes in image features to the robot's motion [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736584510000645]. A primary challenge in visual servoing is the estimation of this feature Jacobian matrix and its pseudoinverse, particularly in uncalibrated environments [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736584510000645].

Modern control theory offers several methods to address this challenge. These include the development of on-line estimation algorithms that compute the Jacobian based on the robot's previous movements [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221472673_Image_Based_Visual_Servoing_A_New_Method_for_the_Estimation_of_the_Image_Jacobian_in_Dynamic_Environments], the use of advanced filtering schemes such as Kalman-neural-networks [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736584510000645], and the application of reinforcement learning frameworks to adaptively adjust the image Jacobian matrix in real-time [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197625017804].

An alternative and more recent approach is to formulate a state-space model through state representation learning. This method constructs a compact state representation of the robot's configuration directly from images and learns the system's transition dynamics from collected execution traces. The learned model is then used to compute control velocities to move the robot to a desired goal state, which is also identified by its image. A significant advantage of this technique is its ability to function effectively even with an uncalibrated camera [https://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2025-094.pdf].

Search Query: survey of State Representation Learning methods for vision-based robotic control and dynamics modeling
Search Answer: State Representation Learning (SRL) is a method used for vision-based robotic control, and surveys on the topic often categorize these methods within a model-free online setting where agents learn state information [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392941690_A_Survey_of_State_Representation_Learning_for_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17518, https://arxiv.org/html/2506.17518v1].

One specific approach for visual servo-control uses images from an uncalibrated camera to build compact state representations of a robot's configuration. In this method, the system learns transition dynamics from collected execution traces to compute the control velocities needed to reach a desired goal state, which is also identified by an image [https://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2025-094.pdf].

A common model design for this type of task features two primary components: state representation and state prediction. For the state representation component, some models utilize a spatially aware approach [https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/13/3/231].

Search Query: classical system identification techniques for estimating image Jacobian in visual servoing from input-output data
Search Answer: In the context of designing a system for 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, the control system for automated image acquisition is a critical component. A key technique for this is visual servoing, where the estimation of the image Jacobian from input-output data is essential.

Several classical system identification techniques are used for this purpose. A popular approach is to use previously collected sample data of robot positions and sensor signal values to approximate a solution ["https://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2008/uk/ISPRA/ispra-06.pdf"]. Specific estimation methods evaluated for their effectiveness in visual servoing include Recursive Least Squares (RLS), FUNDMAT (which utilizes the fundamental matrix), and ANLTC, which are often compared against the Analytic Jacobian method ["https://www.academia.edu/28777782/Image_based_visual_servoing_Estimated_image_Jacobian_by_using_fundamental_matrix_VS_analytic_Jacobian", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50991888_Image_Based_Visual_Servoing_Estimated_Image_Jacobian_by_Using_Fundamental_Matrix_VS_Analytic_Jacobian"].

These techniques are frequently applied in Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) systems. Further research addresses more advanced scenarios, such as the robust estimation of the visual-motor Jacobian for uncalibrated IBVS systems ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224156371_Robust_Jacobian_Estimation_for_Uncalibrated_Visual_Servoing"]. For systems employing stereo vision, another scheme involves estimating the image Jacobian by using lines as features ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251919514_Image_Base_Visual_Servoing_Estimation_of_the_image_Jacobian_by_using_lines_in_a_stereo_vision_system"].

The system will be implemented in an "eye-in-hand" configuration, where a 3D camera is mounted on a robotic manipulator. This setup provides the necessary mobility to actively view the crop grain from multiple perspectives to build a complete model.

**2.2 Control System Architecture:**
A dual-task, closed-loop visual control law will govern the system's behavior. This control law utilizes real-time visual feedback to guide the robotic manipulator.

*   **Inputs:** The control law will use data from a segmented point cloud of the target grain and a probabilistic occupancy map, which is continuously updated to represent the reconstructed model.
*   **Dual-Task Control Law:** The controller is designed to perform two tasks simultaneously:
    1.  **Object Tracking:** The primary task is to maintain the camera's focus on the crop grain, ensuring it remains centered in the field of view.
    2.  **Exploration & Reconstruction:** The secondary task is to actively explore the grain's surface by maximizing a Next-Best-View (NBV) objective. The system will continuously calculate and move the camera to the optimal next viewpoint to reveal unmapped areas, thereby ensuring a comprehensive 3D reconstruction.

This dual-task approach allows the system to build the 3D model efficiently while keeping the object of interest in view, a critical function for robust operation.

Search Query: derivation of kinematic model for image-based visual servoing relating camera velocity to image feature dynamics via the image Jacobian
Search Answer: The kinematic model for image-based visual servoing is fundamental for designing kinematic controllers. This model establishes a relationship between the camera's velocity and the dynamics of features within an image through a concept known as the image Jacobian or interaction matrix [3, 4, https://robotacademy.net.au/lesson/the-image-jacobian/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDE6oxEJn3c].

The Jacobian matrix, which can be for instance a two-by-six matrix, relates the camera's spatial velocity, including its translational components, to the velocity of the image features [3, 4, https://robotacademy.net.au/lesson/the-image-jacobian/]. This model is crucial for designing the kinematic controllers that guide the imaging system [5, https://inria.hal.science/inria-00436722v1/document].

Various methods exist for the derivation and implementation of the image Jacobian. These include innovative algorithms for its on-line estimation in dynamic environments based on previous movements [1, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221472673_Image_Based_Visual_Servoing_A_New_Method_for_the_Estimation_of_the_Image_Jacobian_in_Dynamic_Environments]. Additionally, specific derivations have been developed for different imaging technologies, such as the light field image Jacobian for use in light field-based visual servoing [2, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017IRAL....2..912T/abstract].

Search Query: formal state-space representation for active 3D reconstruction modeling the evolution of object geometry estimates as system state
Search Answer: Based on the provided information, a formal state-space representation for active 3D reconstruction, which models the evolution of object geometry estimates as the system state, could not be found.

The search results do mention state-space models, but in different contexts such as for actuator systems and multivariate time series forecasting ["https://css.paperplaza.net/conferences/conferences/ACC25/program/ACC25_ContentListWeb_3.html", "https://ecai2025.org/accepted-papers/"].

Separately, the documents discuss the evolution of 3D reconstruction techniques. They note a shift from traditional methods like Structure from Motion (SfM), which use explicit geometric modeling, to newer methods with implicit depth representation, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) ["https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/18/5748"]. There is also a recognized need for robust online methods capable of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes in real-time ["https://openreview.net/pdf/47e4f7aed1fadec7617b0314d78968366b8e661d.pdf"].

However, the provided results do not connect the concepts of state-space modeling and 3D reconstruction to provide the specific formal model requested.

Search Query: modeling information gain dynamics for next-best-view 3D reconstruction
Search Answer: To address the tasks of modeling, analysis, and design for 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, a key area to model is the information gain dynamics for next-best-view (NBV) 3D reconstruction. This involves selecting the optimal subsequent viewpoints for a camera, often mounted on a mobile robot, to efficiently build a volumetric model of an object [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487527, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303719117_An_Information_Gain_Formulation_for_Active_Volumetric_3D_Reconstruction].

One approach is to utilize a utility function to evaluate and select viewpoints. This function bases its decision on the potential information gain, along with other factors such as the distance to the next viewpoint and the density of the existing model [https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/20/2440]. Within this framework, entropy is a crucial metric used to quantify the information gain within the volumetric map. The effectiveness of this process is evaluated by tracking metrics such as surface coverage and entropy reduction throughout the reconstruction steps [https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/ICRA16_Isler.pdf].

For implementation, various algorithms can be employed to solve the NBV problem, including specific methods like cluster-based path planning [https://hal.science/hal-03086499/file/HaMoMoMaMo_IROS20.pdf].

Search Query: probabilistic models of 3D object reconstruction for active vision and next-best-view planning
Search Answer: For the 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, this design report outlines a system based on active vision and control theory principles. The core of this system is an active 3D reconstruction framework designed to efficiently and accurately model each grain.

This framework operates in a continuous cycle that involves inferring an optimal viewpoint, moving a sensor to capture new data from that view, and integrating this data to update and refine the 3D model of the grain. A critical component of this automated process is the strategic planning of a set of sensor locations, or "views," to ensure a complete and high-fidelity reconstruction with minimal acquisitions.

The primary control problem within this framework is the determination of the "Next-Best-View" (NBV). The NBV is the next sensor position that is predicted to yield the most valuable information for completing the 3D model. Several theoretical methods and models can be employed for this task:

*   **Probabilistic and Volumetric Methods**: A foundational approach for NBV selection is a probabilistic, volumetric method that operates on a partial model of the unknown 3D object. This technique uses a volumetric representation, often employing voxels, to model the grain. By analyzing the current state of the voxel grid (e.g., distinguishing between known empty, known occupied, and unknown space), the algorithm can probabilistically determine the view that will resolve the most uncertainty and reveal the largest unknown portion of the object's surface.

*   **Predictive Shape Completion Methods**: To enhance realism and efficiency, more advanced methods like Pred-NBV can be implemented. This approach leverages an enhanced 3D prediction model, potentially trained on a large dataset of object shapes (such as the ShapeNet dataset), to predict the complete geometry of the grain from a limited number of initial scans. This predicted shape then guides the NBV selection process, focusing the sensor on areas where the initial model and the predicted model have the highest discrepancy, thereby refining the reconstruction more intelligently.

Search Query: derivation of error dynamics for image-based visual servoing control using the image Jacobian
Search Answer: In the context of 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, a control system based on Image-Based Visual Servo (IBVS) can be designed. The primary objective of an IBVS control system is to minimize an error, `e(t)`, defined within the image plane [https://dellaert.github.io/21S-8803MM/Readings/L7%20Visual%20Servo%20Control.pdf]. This error is expressed by the equation `e(t) = s(t) - s*`, where `s(t)` represents a set of current image measurements (such as the coordinates of interest points or parameters of image segments), and `s*` represents the desired or target measurements. The fundamental aim of the control scheme is to drive this error `e(t)` to zero [https://dellaert.github.io/21S-8803MM/Readings/L7%20Visual%20Servo%20Control.pdf].

The control process utilizes a full-rank Image Jacobian matrix (Jimg), also known as an interaction matrix, which establishes the connection between the camera's velocity and the corresponding changes in the image features [https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1344440/18465862505.pdf, https://open.clemson.edu/context/all_theses/article/4446/viewcontent/Allen_clemson_0050M_16045.pdf]. Specifically, the error dynamics relate the time derivative of the error, `ė(t)`, to the camera's velocity, `ξ`, through this Jacobian matrix. Based on this relationship, a control law is designed to generate the necessary camera velocities to minimize the defined error, ultimately driving `e(t)` to zero [https://dellaert.github.io/21S-8803MM/Readings/L7%20Visual%20Servo%20Control.pdf, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15599610802303579].

Search Query: state-space representation of image-based visual servoing error dynamics for exponential decay control law design
Search Answer: A proposed control system for automated image acquisition utilizes image-based visual servoing. The primary objective of this vision-based control scheme is to minimize an error, `e(t)`, which is defined as the difference between a set of current image measurements, `s(t)`, and a desired set of measurements, `s*`. This relationship is represented by the equation: `e(t) = s(t) - s*`.

For more granular control, the image measurements `s(t)` can be expressed as a function of specific measured features, `m(t)` (such as the coordinates of points of interest), and other parameters, `a`. This provides a more detailed error definition: `e(t) = s(m(t), a) - s*`.

The control strategy to minimize this error involves creating compact state representations of the robot's configuration from the captured images. These representations, combined with transition dynamics learned from execution traces, are used to compute the control velocities required to guide the robot. This process directs the robot to a desired goal state, which is identified by its corresponding target image, `s*`.

Search Query: quadratic programming formulation for integrating visual servoing controllers with control barrier functions for field-of-view safety guarantees
Search Answer: Control Barrier Function (CBF) based quadratic programs (QPs) are an established and effective method for enforcing safety in critical systems, particularly those with potentially conflicting control objectives and safety constraints [https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/CBF-based_hierarchical_quadratic_programs_with_guaranteed_feasibility_for_safety-critical_systems/30830948, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160906408A/abstract]. This approach is formulated as a Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programming Framework (CBF-QP) to address the coupling between these objectives and constraints, ensuring safe and efficient operations [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08129].

In the context of vision-based control, which is central to your research in 3D reconstruction, CBFs can be used to enforce safety constraints without requiring a complete environmental map [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372131019_Enforcing_safety_for_vision-based_controllers_via_Control_Barrier_Functions_and_Neural_Radiance_Fields]. A practical strategy involves integrating this methodology with image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to manage operational tasks. This creates a comprehensive control strategy for systems, such as mobile manipulators, to perform their functions while maintaining safety [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889024001970].

### **Design Report: Application of Modern Control Theory for 3D Reconstruction and Phenotypic Analysis of Crop Grains**

**1. Introduction and System Overview**

This report outlines a design framework for the automated 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, leveraging principles from modern control theory. The core task involves controlling a camera's position and orientation relative to a grain sample to acquire the necessary images for reconstruction. For this purpose, **Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS)** is identified as a highly relevant and effective control method.

IBVS is a control strategy where a robot manipulates a camera to ensure that the features observed in the camera's image converge to a desired state. The control action is determined directly from the dynamics of feature points within the image plane.

**2. System Modeling and Analysis**

The proposed system can be modeled as a **Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)** system. In this context, the inputs are the velocity commands sent to the robotic system holding the camera, and the outputs are the positions of key feature points on the grain as captured in the 2D image plane.

A central component in the IBVS control loop is the **Image Jacobian matrix (Jimg)**. This matrix establishes the linear relationship between the camera's velocity and the corresponding velocity of the feature points in the image. For effective control, a full-rank Image Jacobian matrix is utilized.

An innovative aspect of this approach is the potential to use an algorithm for the **online estimation of the Image Jacobian**. This allows the system to adapt to dynamic environments or variations in the system's parameters without needing a precise, pre-calibrated model, which is highly advantageous for agricultural applications where grain size, shape, and orientation may vary.

**3. System Dynamics and Control Law**

While the foundational principles of IBVS are well-established, the specific system dynamics equation in the state-space form `ẋ = f(x, u)` is not explicitly available in the provided reference materials. However, the control law is based on the dynamics of the image points. The relationship is governed by the Image Jacobian, which connects the change in image features to the camera's motion, forming the basis for designing the controller that drives the image error to zero.

Search Query: derivation of nonlinear state-space model ẋ=f(x,u) for image-based visual servoing where state vector x represents image features and dynamics f(x,u) are defined by the image Jacobian
Search Answer: In the application of modern control theory to image-based visual servoing for 3D reconstruction, a central challenge is the accurate estimation of the Jacobian matrix and the design of the corresponding control law algorithm [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11178].

To address this, one effective method is an algorithm for the on-line estimation of the image Jacobian. This approach utilizes previous movements to dynamically update the estimation, making it suitable for dynamic environments [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221472673_Image_Based_Visual_Servoing_A_New_Method_for_the_Estimation_of_the_Image_Jacobian_in_Dynamic_Environments].

It is important to note, however, that while the importance of the image Jacobian is highlighted, a specific derivation for a nonlinear state-space model, such as `ẋ=f(x,u)`, for image-based visual servoing is not provided in the source materials. The primary focus remains on methods for estimating the Jacobian rather than detailing the complete formulation of the state-space dynamics [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221472673_Image_Based_Visual_Servoing_A_New_Method_for_the_Estimation_of_the_Image_Jacobian_in_Dynamic_Environments, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11178].

Search Query: mathematical derivation of image Jacobian matrix for point features in visual servoing
Search Answer: In the design of an automated system for the 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, modern control theory provides a robust framework for precise data acquisition, particularly when using robotic manipulators and vision systems. A key approach in this domain is visual servoing, where the control of the robot is based on visual feedback.

Central to the modeling and analysis of such a system is the **image Jacobian matrix**, also known as the interaction matrix or feature Jacobian (Js). This matrix is crucial as it mathematically relates the motion of a rigid body (e.g., a camera mounted on a robot arm) to the corresponding changes in image features (e.g., key points on a crop grain) [https://limbs.lcsr.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cowangeometric2005.pdf, https://inria.hal.science/hal-00920414v1/document]. The feature Jacobian matrix can be denoted as Js ∈ Rk×n, where n is the number of robot joints [https://inria.hal.science/hal-00920414v1/document].

A significant challenge in the design and implementation of visual servoing systems is obtaining this matrix and its pseudoinverse, especially in uncalibrated setups where the exact camera and system parameters are unknown [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736584510000645]. To overcome the difficulty of direct mathematical derivation, various theoretical models and methods have been developed for robustly estimating the feature Jacobian. These advanced estimation techniques are critical for creating an adaptive and reliable control system. Notable methods include:
*   Extreme Learning Machines (ELM)
*   Fuzzy Logic (FL)
*   Kalman-neural-network filtering schemes

By employing these estimation methods, it is possible to design a high-performance control system for the precise positioning of sensors relative to the grain samples, ensuring high-quality data for subsequent 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736584510000645, http://culturetechlab.culture.upatras.gr/sites/default/files/downloads/rcim_10.pdf, http://vigir.missouri.edu/~gdesouza/Research/Conference_CDs/IEEE_ICRA_2010/data/papers/1516.pdf].

Search Query: derivation of image feature velocity equation ṡ = J(s, z)v_c for visual servoing
Search Answer: In the application of visual servoing for robotic control, a core theoretical model establishes the relationship between the velocity of visual features in an image and the velocity of the camera. This relationship is expressed by the equation ṡ = J(s, z)v_c, often written as ṡ(t) = LsVc.

The components of this equation are defined as follows:
*   **ṡ** represents the time derivative or velocity of **s**, which is a vector of the values of the visual features being tracked.
*   **v_c** is a vector, typically 6x1, that denotes the camera's velocity.
*   **J** or **Ls** is a matrix known as the Image Jacobian or the interaction matrix. This matrix maps the camera's velocity to the resulting velocity of the features in the image, describing how the visual feature vector **s** is modified when the camera moves with a velocity **v**. The role of the Image Jacobian is analogous to that of a classical robot Jacobian.

This equation is fundamental to a real-time, closed-loop control scheme designed to manipulate a robot's motion. The control system works by calculating the error between the current visual features and the desired visual features. Based on this error, a control output, typically the robot's velocity, is continuously updated to minimize the error and reduce it to zero. This process involves inverting the image Jacobian to derive the necessary camera velocity required to produce the desired change in visual features.

Search Query: analytical derivation of interaction matrix (image Jacobian) for a 3D point feature in image-based visual servoing
Search Answer: For the task of 3D reconstruction and phenotypic analysis of crop grains, a design report incorporating modern control theory can be structured around a visual servoing framework. This approach uses visual feedback to control a camera or sensor system for automated and precise data acquisition.

**Modeling and Analysis: The Analytical Jacobian**

A core component of a visual servoing control system is the image Jacobian, which relates the velocity of the camera to the motion of features in the image. The image Jacobian is composed of an interaction matrix. The analytical derivation of this matrix for a generic point feature—a common feature type for identifying points on a grain's surface—can be accomplished using Green formulas [http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/deluca/rob2_en/17_VisualServoing.pdf]. In this control scheme, 3D features such as points and planes on the crop grain can be used to guide the sensor-equipped robot's end-effector to desired positions for comprehensive scanning [https://arxiv.org/html/2405.18830v1].

**Design Challenges and Alternative Approaches**

A significant challenge with implementing a purely analytical model is that the interaction matrix depends on spatial information, particularly the depth of the visual features from the camera, which is often unknown or difficult to measure accurately in a dynamic setting [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10549]. This dependency makes the direct use of the analytic Jacobian impractical for many applications.

To overcome this limitation, the system design can incorporate methods for Jacobian approximation and estimation. Several alternatives to the analytic Jacobian are available:
*   **Online Estimation Methods:** The Jacobian can be estimated online using various algorithms. These are often compared to the analytic Jacobian and include methods such as FUNDMAT (based on the fundamental matrix), RLS (Recursive Least Squares), and ANLTC [https://www.academia.edu/28777782/Image_based_visual_servoing_Estimated_image_Jacobian_by_using_fundamental_matrix_VS_analytic_Jacobian].
*   **Learning-Based Methods:** For uncalibrated systems, local estimation of the Jacobian can be achieved through training [http://culturetechlab.culture.upatras.gr/sites/default/files/downloads/rcim_10.pdf]. This approach can adapt to the specific sensor and hardware configuration without requiring precise prior calibration.

In summary, while the analytical derivation of the image Jacobian provides a strong theoretical foundation for modeling the system, a practical design for 3D grain phenotyping will likely rely on Jacobian estimation techniques to create a robust and adaptive control system capable of handling uncertainties in the physical environment.

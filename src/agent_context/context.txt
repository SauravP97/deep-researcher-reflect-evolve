According to his 2007 annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, these criteria include investing in a business one can understand, that has favorable long-term economics, is run by able and trustworthy management, and is available at a sensible price tag [https://www.scribd.com/document/966615404/Motilal-Oswal-Wealth-Creation-study-2025]. The principle of an "understandable business" means the business model should be simple and predictable, a concept known as the "Circle of Competence" [https://www.facebook.com/groups/322661495555943/posts/1608908593597887/].

Search Query: Benjamin Graham "value investing" principles influence on Warren Buffett
Search Answer: Benjamin Graham was Warren Buffett's first teacher, introducing him to the principles of value investing [https://www.safalniveshak.com/value-investing-course-graham-to-buffett/]. Buffett, Graham's most renowned protégé, adapted these principles throughout his career [https://digitaldefynd.com/IQ/evolution-of-value-investing/]. The value investing approach Buffett learned from Graham follows three core, risk-mitigating principles [https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/what-benjamin-graham-taught-warren-buffett-about-investing].

While Buffett began his career adhering strictly to Graham's methods, his philosophy evolved, partly due to the influence of others like Charlie Munger and Philip Fisher [https://www.grahamvalue.com/article/warren-buffett-value-investor, https://sites.duke.edu/djepapers/files/2016/08/bierig.pdf]. Munger reportedly guided Buffett away from so-called "cigar butt stocks" and towards a more complete application of Graham's principles [https://www.grahamvalue.com/article/warren-buffett-value-investor]. Philip Fisher's writings stressed the importance of owning high-quality businesses for the long term and avoiding excessive diversification [https://sites.duke.edu/djepapers/files/2016/08/bierig.pdf]. This influence marked a meaningful deviation from Graham's teachings, shifting Buffett's goal to finding "businesses with good to superb underlying economics, run by honest and able people and [available] at sensible prices" that he could hold "forever." Despite these adaptations, Buffett's investment style maintains a "larger allegiance" to Graham's foundational principles [https://sites.duke.edu/djepapers/files/2016/08/bierig.pdf].

Search Query: Warren Buffett investment philosophy shift from "cigar-butt" investing to "wonderful companies at a fair price" role of Charlie Munger and Philip Fisher
Search Answer: Warren Buffett's investment philosophy is centered on value investing, which involves purchasing stocks that are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value [https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/articles/investment-philosophy/]. Initially, he followed his mentor Ben Graham's "cigar butt" approach, which entails looking for a bargain purchase with one last bit of profit, much like a discarded cigar with one puff left [https://medium.com/@zanes/5-amazing-warren-buffett-metaphors-517f52d2e75e, https://www.wealthyparrot.com/warren-buffett-quotes/]. This philosophy evolved into quality-focused value investing, a pivotal shift driven by his long-time partner, Charlie Munger [https://www.wealthyparrot.com/warren-buffett-quotes/]. Munger is a strong proponent of “buying wonderful companies at a fair price” [https://wire.insiderfinance.io/how-much-did-warren-buffett-make-from-his-coke-investment-bb2198d97e09]. Another reason for this change was that as the size of Buffett's portfolio grew, the "cigar butt" strategy became inefficient [https://wire.insiderfinance.io/how-much-did-warren-buffett-make-from-his-coke-investment-bb2198d97e09].

The See's Candies purchase was a move toward buying a "wonderful company at a fair price" [sbo.financial/blog/financial-teardowns/sees-candies-a-financial-teardown/].

Charlie Munger was instrumental in pushing the deal forward [https://www.tastingtable.com/1960679/warren-buffets-favorite-sees-candy/].

A key factor was the company's pricing power, or its ability to raise prices without losing customers; See's consistently raised prices annually, sometimes by as much as 17% [sbo.financial/blog/financial-teardowns/sees-candies-a-financial-teardown/]. This acquisition taught Buffett and Munger a vital lesson about the power of a good brand and had a greater impact on their investment style than any other company [https://hedgefundalpha.com/investment-strategy/why-buying-sees-candy-was-such-a-big-deal-for-warren-buffett/, https://www.sees.com/about-us/corporate].

Initially, Buffett was a classic value investor in the style of Benjamin Graham, buying stocks at low prices relative to their current earnings and assets [https://www.aaii.com/journal/article/14972-warren-buffett-and-the-evolution-of-value-investing, https://can-turtles-fly.blogspot.com/2011/12/warren-buffetts-evolution-and-his-three.html]. This often involved purchasing secondary or weaker companies [https://can-turtles-fly.blogspot.com/2011/12/warren-buffetts-evolution-and-his-three.html].

Munger convinced Buffett to shift his strategy toward buying better businesses with low capital-intensive needs that generate high amounts of cash and high returns on capital, and then holding onto them [https://www.aaii.com/journal/article/14972-warren-buffett-and-the-evolution-of-value-investing, https://can-turtles-fly.blogspot.com/2011/12/warren-buffetts-evolution-and-his-three.html]. This philosophy drove Berkshire Hathaway's returns from the 1970s into the 1990s [https://www.aaii.com/journal/article/14972-warren-buffett-and-the-evolution-of-value-investing].

Later, the dominance of the technology sector prompted Buffett to re-examine his thinking [https://fortune.com/longform/value-investing-warren-buffett-tech-stocks/]. His investment in Apple showed that tech stocks can align with value principles if they possess sustainable business advantages and return capital to shareholders [https://www.trustnet.com/investing/13445249/warren-buffett-and-the-tech-sector-a-changing-perspective]. This illustrates a key lesson: maintaining discipline while remaining adaptable [https://www.trustnet.com/investing/13445249/warren-buffett-and-the-tech-sector-a-changing-perspective]. Despite the shift to low capital-intensive businesses, Buffett and Munger still invest in capital-intensive businesses [https://acquirersmultiple.com/2022/10/warren-buffett-charlie-munger-why-we-still-invest-in-capital-intensive-businesses/].

Search Query: arguments against Warren Buffett's performance "survivorship bias" OR "luck"
Search Answer: Multiple studies and analyses conclude that Warren Buffett's investment success is not attributable to luck or survivorship bias. One study suggests Buffett's outperformance was not a result of luck or timing [https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/buffetts-alpha-skill-or-luck]. Other sources state that his returns are not due to luck or magic, but rather to his strategy of consistently choosing securities with specific characteristics [https://www.acadian-asset.com/investment-insights/owenomics/buffetts-bad-advice, https://knowledge.skema.edu/is-warren-buffett-exception/]. Research has concluded that Buffett's results cannot be explained by luck alone [http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.economics.20120206.04.html]. While survivorship bias is a real phenomenon, statistical tools like a t-statistic can be used to measure whether results are genuinely significant or could be attributed to luck [https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/post/does-warren-buffett-beat-the-market].

Search Query: academic analysis of "Buffett's Alpha" luck OR "survivorship bias" filetype:pdf
Search Answer: Academic analysis, particularly the paper "Buffett's Alpha" by Frazzini et al.

The reasoning is that Buffett's alpha cannot be explained by standard factors commonly studied by academics, pointing to his capability as the source of his returns [https://static.twentyoverten.com/5b466f7a007b6314372603a2/14NTEa0NAL/Buffett-s-Alpha.pdf, https://access.archive-ouverte.unige.ch/access/metadata/5a65381b-0883-4529-910e-a5e8a0720bf6/download].

Search Query: analysis arguing Warren Buffett's outperformance is attributable to luck or survivorship bias
Search Answer: The argument that Warren Buffett's success is attributable to survivorship bias suggests it is a mathematical probability that if enough people try to pick winning stocks over a long period, some 'lucky' investors will inevitably succeed [https://www.quora.com/Are-famous-investors-like-Warren-Buffett-really-that-skillful-or-is-it-simply-a-mathematical-probability-that-if-enough-people-try-to-pick-winner-stocks-over-a-period-of-time-some-lucky-investors-will-always-be]. However, other sources argue against this. One study concluded that Buffett's outperformance was not a result of luck or timing [https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/buffetts-alpha-skill-or-luck]. Another perspective is that those who attribute Buffett's success to survivorship bias often have lackluster investment results themselves [https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2022/07/27/survivorship-bias/]. Buffett's five-decade track record of outperforming the S&P 500 is often presented as evidence of skill over luck [https://www.quora.com/Are-famous-investors-like-Warren-Buffett-really-that-skillful-or-is-it-simply-a-mathematical-probability-that-if-enough-people-try-to-pick-winner-stocks-over-a-period-of-time-some-lucky-investors-will-always-be, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1641495_code87814.pdf?abstractid=1635061&mirid=1].

Search Query: Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) core tenets and three forms
Search Answer: The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) suggests that asset prices fully reflect all available information [https://legal-resources.uslegalforms.com/e/efficient-market-hypothesis-emh]. The hypothesis is presented in three forms, representing different levels of market efficiency: weak, semi-strong, and strong [https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-notes/7038437, https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/sell-side/capital-markets/efficient-markets-hypothesis/].

*   **Weak Form**: This form posits that current stock prices reflect all historical price data. Consequently, technical analysis is not considered useful for making trading decisions. However, proponents believe fundamental analysis can still identify undervalued and overvalued stocks [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-are-differences-between-weak-strong-and-semistrong-versions-efficient-market-hypothesis.asp].
*   **Semi-Strong Form**: This version asserts that stock prices incorporate all publicly available information. As a result, neither technical nor fundamental analysis can provide investors with an advantage to achieve higher returns [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-are-differences-between-weak-strong-and-semistrong-versions-efficient-market-hypothesis.asp].
*   **Strong Form**: The strongest version of the hypothesis states that stock prices reflect all information, both public and private (insider information). Therefore, no information of any kind can give an investor a market advantage [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-are-differences-between-weak-strong-and-semistrong-versions-efficient-market-hypothesis.asp].

Search Query: Eugene Fama arguments and evidence for Efficient Market Hypothesis
Search Answer: Eugene Fama's Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) argues that prevailing asset prices fully reflect all available information [https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/efficient-market-hypothesis-emh/, https://www.saintpeters.edu/wp-content/uploads/blogs.dir/270/files/2022/12/Da-Souza-MS-Finance-EMH-vs-Behavioral.pdf]. The theory posits that because all information is already incorporated into prices, any attempts to outperform the market by finding mispriced securities are a result of "luck" rather than skill [https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/efficient-market-hypothesis-emh/]. Fama did not claim that markets are perfectly efficient, where prices would incorporate all information at all times [https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Fama.html].

The EMH is presented in three forms [https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/efficient-market-hypothesis-emh/]:
1.  **Weak Form:** All past trading information, like prices and volume, is reflected in market prices.
2.  **Semi-Strong Form:** All publicly available information is reflected in current prices.
3.  **Strong Form:** All public and private information, including insider information, is reflected in prices.

As evidence for the EMH, event studies generally conclude that stock prices adjust quickly to new information, which corroborates the hypothesis [https://www.saintpeters.edu/wp-content/uploads/blogs.dir/270/files/2022/12/Da-Souza-MS-Finance-EMH-vs-Behavioral.pdf]. However, Fama also noted the "joint-hypothesis problem," which makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions about market efficiency from performance evaluation tests [https://www.saintpeters.edu/wp-content/uploads/blogs.dir/270/files/2022/12/Da-Souza-MS-Finance-EMH-vs-Behavioral.pdf].

Search Query: Efficient Market Hypothesis explanation for investment outperformance "Fama-French factors" OR "systematic risk"
Search Answer: The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) posits that asset prices reflect all available information [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis]. It explains investment outperformance not as a market inefficiency, but as compensation for bearing greater systematic risk [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001539, https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/23250/intuition-behind-fama-french-factors]. For instance, it was observed that small stocks and value stocks (those with high book-to-market ratios) tended to achieve abnormally high returns that could not be explained by the standard Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis]. The Fama-French three-factor model was introduced to demonstrate that these higher returns could be explained by additional risk factors beyond the market as a whole, specifically factors related to company size (SMB) and value (investment/asset growth) [https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/23250/intuition-behind-fama-french-factors].

Search Query: NetEase "Westward Journey Online" success factors and competitive advantages China gaming market 2001-2003
Search Answer: In the Chinese gaming market of 2001-2003, NetEase's "Westward Journey Online" succeeded by leveraging strong cultural IP and a key strategic decision to self-develop its games, which set it apart from competitors licensing Korean titles like Shanda's "Legend of Mir II" [1, 4]. Launched in December 2001 [3, 9], the game was based on the classic Chinese novel "Journey to the West," which gave it significant cultural appeal for local players [1, 6, 8].

A primary competitive advantage was NetEase's focus on in-house development. By creating its own game engine and server technologies, NetEase maintained full control over the game's quality and updates, unlike rivals dependent on foreign licensors [4]. This strategy also resulted in higher profit margins as it eliminated licensing fees [5]. The game operated on a time-based or hourly fee subscription model [1, 4].

"Westward Journey Online" was highly successful, effectively breaking the monopoly of Korean games in the market [1, 9]. Its peak concurrent users (PCU) reached 300,000 [3], with one source claiming it hit 560,000 by the end of 2002 [9]. The game's success established strong brand loyalty and became a major revenue driver, leading to the launch of its sequel, "Westward Journey Online II," in November 2003 [3, 8].

Other research provides alternative explanations from a "behavioral value investing perspective," suggesting that the Frazzini paper was limited because it only examined stock-picking abilities and did not account for Buffett's other skills or emotional discipline [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337306550_Buffett's_alpha_further_explanations_from_a_behavioral_value_investing_perspective, https://obj.portfolioconstructionforum.edu.au/articles_perspectives/Portfolio-Construction-Forum_EO_Buffetts-Alpha.pdf].

Search Query: Efficient Market Hypothesis explanation for manager outperformance "survivorship bias" filetype:pdf
Search Answer: According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), apparent outperformance by fund managers can be explained by survivorship bias. This bias occurs because data on fund performance is often skewed by an overrepresentation of successful funds [https://c.mql5.com/forextsd/forum/170/market_efficiency.pdf]. Unsuccessful firms or funds often go bankrupt or cease to exist, and their poor returns are consequently not included in performance samples after the point of failure [https://scholarworks.uni.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=mtie]. Therefore, when analyzing performance, the data often only includes managers who survived the entire measurement period, creating an artificially high impression of average performance that doesn't account for the managers who failed [https://scholarsarchive.library.albany.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=honorscollege_finance].

Search Answer: The investment philosophies of Duan Yongping, Warren Buffett, and Charlie Munger are all rooted in value investing, with a shared emphasis on long-term holding, understanding the business, and quality management. However, there are nuances to each investor's approach.

**Duan Yongping**
Duan, often called the "Warren Buffett of China," bases his philosophy on value investing principles learned from Buffett and Munger [1, 2, 3]. His core tenets are "value, focus, and long-term holding" [1]. He uses a formula of "Business model + Corporate culture + Price" to evaluate investments, seeking companies with sustainable competitive advantages and strong, ethical management [3]. He is a concentrated, long-term investor with a typical holding period of at least 10 years, and he strictly adheres to the principles of not investing in things he doesn't understand and avoiding short-term speculation [1, 2].

**Warren Buffett**
Buffett's philosophy centers on value investing, which involves buying stocks for less than their intrinsic value [4, 6]. He treats stock purchases as buying a piece of a business, not just a ticker symbol, with a preferred holding period that is "forever" [4]. Key principles include:
*   **Circle of Competence:** Only investing in businesses that he can understand [4, 6].
*   **Business Quality:** Focusing on companies with a durable competitive advantage, or "moat" [6].
*   **Management:** Investing in companies run by honest and competent managers [4, 6].
*   **Margin of Safety:** Buying a business at a significant discount to its intrinsic value to protect against errors and bad luck [4, 8].

**Charlie Munger**
Munger's philosophy strongly influenced Buffett's, shifting him from buying "fair companies at wonderful prices" to buying "wonderful companies at fair prices" [5, 7]. Munger places a heavy emphasis on the quality of the business over a statistically cheap price [5]. His approach is characterized by:
*   **Multidisciplinary Thinking:** Using a lattice of "mental models" from various fields like psychology, history, and math to make better decisions [5, 7].
*   **Patience:** He is a proponent of "sit on your ass" investing, waiting patiently for the right, high-quality opportunity to arise [5].
*   **Four-Step Checklist:** Munger utilizes a four-step process that involves understanding the business, assessing its long-term competitive advantages, ensuring management is trustworthy, and buying the stock at a price that provides a margin of safety [8].

Search Query: Efficient Market Hypothesis academic explanation for "market anomalies" like the value premium
Search Answer: The provided search results frame market anomalies as persistent challenges to the validity of the Efficient-Market Hypothesis (EMH), rather than offering an explanation for them from within the EMH framework [https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0876.pdf, https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp]. The EMH states that in an efficient market, asset prices fully and rapidly incorporate all relevant information, making it impossible for investors to consistently earn above-average returns [https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0876.pdf]. This efficiency is driven by rational investors or arbitrageurs buying and selling mispriced stocks until their prices reflect their fundamental value [https://c.mql5.com/forextsd/forum/171/efficient_market_hypothesis_versus_market_anomalies.pdf]. Academic papers often test the EMH by examining anomalies based on factors like price-to-earnings ratios and market values [https://c.mql5.com/forextsd/forum/171/efficient_market_hypothesis_versus_market_anomalies.pdf].

Search Query: risk-based explanations for the value premium anomaly under the Efficient Market Hypothesis
Search Answer: The debate over the source of the value premium centers on whether it is risk-based or a behavioral anomaly [https://alphaarchitect.com/value-premium-risk-mispricing/]. Risk-based explanations are closely associated with the efficient market hypothesis [https://www.robeco.com/en-us/insights/2022/02/human-instincts-drive-the-value-premium]. One specific risk-based theory is that the premiums on value and small stocks serve as signals for changes in future investment opportunities, thus constituting an ICAPM (Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model) risk [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927539817300932]. However, some research indicates that risk-based theories are inconsistent with the data and that risk does not fully account for the value premium [https://www.robeco.com/en-us/insights/2022/02/human-instincts-drive-the-value-premium, https://academic.oup.com/rof/article-abstract/11/2/143/1670757]. The alternative explanation suggests the value anomaly is caused by overreactions from behavioral biases [https://www.dpaminvestments.com/professional-end-investor/it/it/angle/value-explained].

Search Query: Duan Yongping advice to Ding Lei NetEase 2002 gaming business model
Search Answer: In early 2002, when Ding Lei told Duan Yongping that NetEase was preparing to enter the online gaming business, Ding Lei was also considering selling the company. Duan Yongping encouraged him not to sell and to "keep developing" [https://kr-asia.com/netease-is-preparing-an-ipo-for-its-youdao-dictionary-super-app]. Duan's reasoning was that NetEase had ample cash reserves, and he found Ding Lei to be trustworthy [https://www.alphaexponent.net/p/22-duan-the-dilettante, https://kr-asia.com/netease-is-preparing-an-ipo-for-its-youdao-dictionary-super-app]. At the time, while NetEase wasn't profitable, each share was entitled to $2 in cash [https://www.alphaexponent.net/p/22-duan-the-dilettante].

Search Query: Efficient Market Hypothesis explanation for market anomalies "data mining" OR "data snooping" filetype:pdf
Search Answer: The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) explains certain market anomalies as statistical artifacts resulting from practices known as "data mining" or "data snooping" [2, 4]. This perspective suggests that many anomalies are not genuine market inefficiencies but rather illusions discovered by chance [1].

Data snooping occurs when researchers repeatedly analyze large financial datasets, testing numerous hypotheses until a seemingly significant pattern or profitable trading rule emerges [3, 6]. Due to the sheer volume of tests conducted, some patterns will appear statistically significant purely by random chance, a phenomenon known as the "multiple testing problem" or "multiple comparisons problem" [3, 6]. Consequently, many of the hundreds of documented anomalies are likely "false discoveries" [3].

According to proponents of the EMH, these data-mined anomalies typically do not withstand further scrutiny. They often weaken, disappear, or fail to replicate when tested on different time periods or datasets [2, 4]. For example, certain calendar-based anomalies are suspected of being products of data mining because they appear in one data sample but not another [1]. Therefore, from an EMH standpoint, these anomalies do not represent true, exploitable profit opportunities but are instead predictable outcomes of extensive statistical analysis on historical data [2].

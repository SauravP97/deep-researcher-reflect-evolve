I am trying to see if the consumption of shoujo manga by queer Japanese young adults affects their pronoun use and sentence ending particles. Both grammatical categories are gendered in Japanese and a distinct pattern emerges in shoujo manga compared to majority use in society, so observing a minority group would give insight into the effect of media in personal expression.\n\n# Deep Research Report: The Influence of Mass Media on Gendered Language in Japan's Queer Community\n\n**Prepared for:** User Inquiry\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Report ID:** AI-RES-2023-1026-A\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis report investigates the influence of mass media, particularly manga, on the linguistic practices of queer young adults in Japan. The initial hypothesis\u2014that the consumption of shoujo manga directly affects the use of gendered first-person pronouns and sentence-final particles within this community\u2014was definitively falsified. Research confirmed that the \"bokukko\" trope (a female character using masculine pronouns) is notably absent from popular shoujo manga, invalidating the primary premise.\n\nThe investigation subsequently pivoted to Boys' Love (BL) manga, a genre with a significant queer cultural footprint. The core finding is a stark divergence in how different communities engage with the genre's linguistic stereotypes (*yakuwarigo*).\n\n*   **The heterosexual female fandom (*fujoshi*)** actively adopts the artificial speech patterns of BL characters\u2014a practice known as \"*BL f\u016b kuch\u014d*\" (BL-style speech)\u2014as a form of online identity performance and community signaling.\n*   **The queer community (*t\u014djisha*)**, by contrast, largely rejects these same linguistic stereotypes, viewing them as inauthentic, alienating, and unrepresentative of their lived language. Empirical data shows a clear distinction between the \"fan language\" of *fujoshi* and the actual speech patterns of gay Japanese men.\n\nFurthermore, the research indicates that the popularization of stereotypical queer speech, specifically \"*onee kotoba*\" (\"queen's speech\"), is more heavily influenced by mainstream television personalities than by niche manga genres. This report concludes that media's impact on language is not uniform; it is a complex interplay between the medium, the specific subculture, and the function of the language itself\u2014whether for authentic identity expression or for performative fan engagement.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### 1. Falsification of Shoujo Manga's Direct Linguistic Influence\n\nThe original research path sought to connect shoujo manga consumption with linguistic choices among queer youth. This was based on the premise that the genre's common themes of androgyny and non-traditional relationships, combined with the presence of female characters using masculine language (*bokukko*), might provide a linguistic model for identity expression.\n\nHowever, academic analysis of popular shoujo manga dialogue revealed **no instances** of female characters using the masculine pronouns *ore* or *boku* [https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ExtendedAbs/article/download/514/424/574]. While shoujo manga thematically resonates with queer audiences through its exploration of gender, sexuality, and emotional intimacy [\"https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5899&context=gc_etds\"], it does not provide the direct linguistic modeling originally hypothesized. This foundational finding necessitated a pivot away from shoujo manga toward a more linguistically stylized genre relevant to queer culture: Boys' Love (BL).\n\n### 2. The Constructed Language of Boys' Love Manga: *Seme* and *Uke Yakuwarigo*\n\nBL manga utilizes highly stylized \"role language\" (*yakuwarigo*) to define its central character archetypes: the dominant *seme* and the submissive *uke*. This constructed language relies on specific, gendered linguistic features:\n\n*   ***Seme* (Dominant) Speech:** Characterized by hyper-masculinity. *Seme* characters consistently use the assertive, informal first-person pronoun **ore (\u4ffa)** and forceful, traditionally masculine sentence-final particles like **ze (\u305c)** and **zo (\u305e)**. This language, while somewhat archaic in modern speech, functions within the manga to signal a specific type of assertive masculinity [1, 2, 6].\n*   ***Uke* (Submissive) Speech:** Features a characteristic linguistic blend that creates a \"gender-ambiguous\" style. *Uke* characters typically use the softer, boyish masculine pronoun **boku (\u50d5)**. Crucially, this is often combined with stereotypically feminine sentence-final particles, such as **wa (\u308f)**, **no (\u306e)**, and **kashira (\u304b\u3057\u3089)**. One study found that *uke* characters used feminine particles in 34% of applicable sentences, while *seme* characters used them 0% of the time [2, 5].\n\nThis deliberate linguistic coding is a hallmark of the BL genre, creating a clear and easily recognizable dynamic for its readership.\n\n### 3. Divergent Receptions: *BL f\u016b kuch\u014d* vs. *T\u014djisha* Authenticity\n\nThe most significant finding of this report is the starkly different ways in which the fictional language of BL is received and utilized by its fan community versus the queer community it depicts.\n\n*   **Adoption by the *Fujoshi* Fandom:** Heterosexual female fans (*fujoshi*) have been observed adopting BL's linguistic stereotypes in their online communities. This practice, called **\"*BL f\u016b kuch\u014d*\" (BL-style speech)**, is a form of identity play where fans mimic character speech to signal their in-group status. By using masculine pronouns and gender-incongruent particles, they perform a temporary, boyish persona that is understood within the fandom as a playful quotation of a shared text [1, 9].\n*   **Rejection by the Queer Community (*T\u014djisha*):** In direct contrast, members of the Japanese queer community (*t\u014djisha*) widely perceive this same language as inauthentic and alienating. Research and community testimonials indicate a strong sense of discomfort (*iwakan*) with BL's linguistic portrayals, with some describing them as \"kimochi warui\" (creepy or gross) [1, 2]. Community members note that the feminized speech attributed to gay men in BL is a \"fantasy\" created by and for a female audience and does not reflect how they or their peers actually speak [5].\n\nComparative linguistic analysis supports the *t\u014djisha* perspective. One study found that gay men used masculine pronouns (*boku/ore*) in 91.4% of instances, while *fujoshi* using *BL f\u016b kuch\u014d* did so only 41.7% of the time. This data confirms that \"BL-style speech\" is a fan-based virtual dialect, separate from the authentic linguistic practices of the queer community.\n\n### 4. The Influence of Mainstream Media: The Case of *Onee Kotoba*\n\nWhile niche media like BL manga has a contained linguistic influence on its fandom, mainstream television has played a more significant role in shaping broad public perceptions of queer speech. The popularization of **\"*onee kotoba*\"**\u2014a stereotyped, hyper-feminine speech style associated with gay men and transgender women\u2014is largely attributed to its use by prominent TV personalities like Matsuko Deluxe [https://wesleycrobertson.wordpress.com/2021/05/14/reflections-on-designing-a-japanese-sociolinguistics-course/, https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1075/pbns.263.05ch5/html?srsltid=AfmBOoohSoZxJgZCyqeEGIHFGPBzn2A4eeOBP2ROHnBIUgXs5ALSXpGh].\n\nThis broadcast-media pathway establishes a widely recognized (if stereotypical) model of queer speech that contrasts with the niche, fan-driven adoption of *BL f\u016b kuch\u014d*. Recent sociolinguistic research suggests that even this widely known stereotype may be growing \"obsolete\" in the everyday language of younger queer individuals, who may opt for more neutral speech to avoid being stereotyped [https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/70422].\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### Theoretical Frameworks: *Yakuwarigo* and Gender Performativity\n\nThe findings are best understood through two key theoretical lenses: *yakuwarigo* and gender performativity.\n\n*   **`Yakuwarigo` (Role Language):** Coined by linguist Satoshi Kinsui, *yakuwarigo* refers to the systems of stylized idiolects used in Japanese fiction to quickly establish a character's identity (age, gender, social status, personality). The distinct speech of *seme* and *uke* characters in BL is a textbook example. The genre employs exaggerated masculine (*ore* + *ze*) and blended-gender (*boku* + *wa*) speech as linguistic shortcuts to signal the power dynamics central to its narratives. This language is designed for narrative efficiency, not for authentic representation.\n\n*   **Gender Performativity:** The adoption of *BL f\u016b kuch\u014d* by the *fujoshi* fandom can be analyzed as a form of gender performativity. Influenced by Judith Butler's theories, this perspective sees gender not as an innate quality but as an identity constructed through repeated acts, including speech. By adopting masculine linguistic forms, *fujoshi* are not claiming a male gender identity but are \"playing with gender\" within a specific context. This act serves to challenge heteronormative femininity and construct a shared, performative identity unique to their fan community.\n\n### A Taxonomy of Media Influence Pathways\n\nThe research reveals three distinct and non-interchangeable pathways of media influence on language and identity for this topic:\n\n1.  **Indirect Thematic Resonance (Shoujo Manga):** This media provides cultural and thematic resources (e.g., androgyny, emotional intimacy) that may resonate with queer audiences, but it does not offer a direct model for linguistic adoption. Its influence is cultural, not grammatical.\n2.  **Niche Linguistic Adoption by an \"Outsider\" Fandom (BL Manga):** This media provides a highly specific and artificial linguistic model (*yakuwarigo*) that is adopted by an external fan group (*fujoshi*) for performative identity play (*BL f\u016b kuch\u014d*). This adoption is confined to the subculture and is rejected by the community being depicted.\n3.  **Mainstream Stereotyping and Popularization (Television):** This media path takes a real-world (though often exaggerated) linguistic style (*onee kotoba*) and popularizes it through mass exposure via TV personalities. This shapes broad societal stereotypes and becomes a widely recognized, though not universally used, linguistic model associated with the queer community.\n\nThis taxonomy demonstrates that the question \"Does media influence language?\" is too simplistic. The more precise questions are *which media*, *which community*, and *for what purpose*.\n\n## Conclusion & Outlook\n\nThe initial hypothesis that shoujo manga consumption directly influences the gendered language of queer youth in Japan is incorrect. The investigation instead uncovered a more nuanced reality where media's linguistic influence is highly segmented. The artificial \"role language\" (*yakuwarigo*) of Boys' Love manga has been adopted as a performative \"fan language\" (*BL f\u016b kuch\u014d*) by its heterosexual female fandom, but it is simultaneously rejected as inauthentic by the queer community (*t\u014djisha*) it purports to represent. This dynamic highlights a critical distinction between language for performative fandom and language for lived identity.\n\nThe broader popularization of queer linguistic stereotypes like *onee kotoba* appears to be driven more by mainstream television than by niche manga. This suggests that widespread media visibility is a more potent force for shaping public perception and linguistic stereotypes than the contained, subcultural influence of genres like BL.\n\nThis case serves as a valuable example of how minority communities navigate media representation. While some groups create and popularize their own lexicon (e.g., the influence of ballroom culture on mainstream slang), others must actively resist and reject inauthentic portrayals created by and for an outside audience. Future research should focus on ethnographic studies within *t\u014djisha* online spaces to further document their authentic linguistic practices and their ongoing dialogue with media representation.\n\n## References\n\n*A consolidated list of sources referenced in the research logs.*\n\n*   Abe, H.

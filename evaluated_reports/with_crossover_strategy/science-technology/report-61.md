# Research on the price dynamics of chub mackerel in major aquatic markets of Pacific Rim countries, and its interannual variations in weight/length. Combined with oceanographic theory, these research findings can further establish direct correlations between high-quality marine biological resources, aquatic markets, fishery economics, and the marine environment.

# Deep Research Report: An Analysis of Chub Mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) Price Dynamics, Biological Variations, and Environmental Linkages in Pacific Rim Fisheries

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) fishery in key Pacific Rim countries—China, Mexico, and the United States—focusing on the interplay between marine environmental conditions, the biological characteristics of the fish, and resulting fishery economics. The research synthesizes data on catch volumes, interannual variations in fish weight and length, market price dynamics, and the influence of major oceanographic phenomena like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

Significant interannual variations in the size and condition of landed chub mackerel were identified in both Mexican and Chinese fisheries. In Mexico, catch volumes are sporadic, and the average size of mackerel varies significantly by region and year. In China, detailed port-sampling data from 2016 to 2022 reveals a consistent trend of increasing maximum weight and length in landed fish. These biological changes are theoretically linked to large-scale oceanographic conditions, such as sea surface temperature (SST) and primary productivity, which are heavily influenced by ENSO and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) cycles.

Economically, the link between biological supply and market price is fundamental. However, a comprehensive time-series analysis of market prices proved challenging. While historical price data (1931–2005) is available for California, continuous, long-term price data for major Chinese markets was not found in the available sources, marking a significant limitation. The core of this report establishes the causal chain: environmental drivers affect the health and abundance of mackerel stocks, which in turn dictates fishery supply (in terms of both volume and quality). This supply directly influences market prices and the overall economic performance of the fishery. Understanding this linkage is critical for developing resilient fisheries management policies and investment strategies in the face of increasing climate variability.

## Key Findings

### 1. Geographic Scope and Major Markets

The commercial fishery for chub mackerel is concentrated in several key regions of the Pacific Rim.
*   **Primary Nations:** China, Mexico, and the United States are major participants in the chub mackerel commercial fishery [https://www.fishsource.org/stock_page/759].
*   **Key Landing Ports:**
    *   **China:** Major landing and wholesale hubs include Ningbo, Xiamen, Shantou, and the Shenjiamen Fishing Port in Zhoushan, one of the world's largest fishing ports [https://www.goldsupplier.com/provide/p169804589.html, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g_JhxFUfps].
    *   **Mexico:** The fishery is centered on the west coast of the Baja California peninsula, with primary fleets based in Ensenada and Magdalena Bay [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/52093/noaa_52093_DS1.pdf].
    *   **United States:** The fishery is most active south of Point Conception, California, with key commercial landing ports in San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura [https://www.pcouncil.org/background-coastal-pelagic-species/].

### 2. Significant Interannual Biological Variations

The physical characteristics (length, weight, and condition) of chub mackerel exhibit considerable year-over-year fluctuations, impacting the overall quality of landings.

*   **Mexico Fishery Data:** The fishery off Baja California is characterized as intermittent and sporadic.
    *   **Catch Volume:** Historical catch has fluctuated dramatically, from a peak of 230,000 tons in 1981 to as low as 1,180 tons in the 2017-2018 season.
    *   **Size Variation:** Captured mackerel typically range from 120 mm to 360 mm in length. Average size varies significantly by season and region; for example, smaller fish (122-266 mm) were found in Bahía Magdalena, while larger specimens (130-360 mm) were sampled in the Gulf of California. The average weight is reported around 300 grams.

*   **China Fishery Data (2016-2022):** Extensive port sampling from Zhoushan and Shidao provides a detailed look at recent biological trends from distant-water fleets.
    *   **Increasing Size Trend:** Over the 2016-2022 period, the maximum observed fork length and body weight of sampled fish consistently increased, rising from a maximum of 41.2 cm and 825.0 g in 2016 to 46.1 cm and 1162.0 g in 2022.
    *   **Length-Weight Relationship:** The allometric growth relationship between fork length (L) and body weight (W) remained stable, consistently calculated with the formula W ≈ 1E-05 * L^2.92. This stability suggests predictable growth patterns despite variations in size distribution.

*   **Fish Condition Factors:** The health of a fish population can be measured using condition factors.
    *   **Fulton's Condition Factor (K):** Calculated as `K = 100*W/L³`, it provides a general measure of fish plumpness.
    *   **Relative Condition Factor (Kn):** Calculated as `Kn = W/W′`, it compares an individual's weight (W) to the expected weight (W') for its length, offering a more precise indicator of condition. Studies show that for chub mackerel, this factor is positively associated with age but not sex.

### 3. Market Price Dynamics and Data Limitations

Analyzing the economic dimension of the fishery reveals significant data gaps, particularly for Chinese markets.

*   **United States (California):** A historical price dataset for chub mackerel covering the years 1931–2005 is available through the NOAA repository, allowing for long-term time-series analysis [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/67708/noaa_67708_DS1.pdf]. However, the raw data was not processed as part of this research.
*   **China:** Despite being a major producer, comprehensive, long-term time-series price data for chub mackerel was not available from sources like the "China Fishery Statistical Yearbook." Available data points are fragmented:
    *   **Ex-vessel Price (1998–2018):** Fluctuation was noted, with a low of 2,360 CNY/tonne in 2003 and a peak of 3,853 CNY/tonne in 2011.
    *   **Wholesale Price (2015):** A single data point from 2015 shows a wholesale price of 11,200 CNY/tonne (11.2 yuan/kg).
    *   **Limitation:** The inability to source continuous price data for China prevents a detailed analysis of seasonality, trends, or volatility in one of the world's largest markets.

### 4. Linkage to Oceanographic Conditions

Oceanographic theory provides a robust framework for understanding the environmental drivers of fluctuations in pelagic fish stocks like chub mackerel.

*   **ENSO and PDO Influence:** Large-scale climatic patterns like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) fundamentally alter marine environments [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280587989_The_impact_of_El_Nino_events_on_the_pelagic_food_chain_in_the_northern_California_Current, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10376808/].
*   **Causal Mechanisms:** Strong El Niño events are associated with warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and reduced coastal upwelling. This disrupts marine food webs by lowering primary productivity (e.g., phytoplankton blooms), which in turn affects the availability of food (e.g., zooplankton) for species like chub mackerel. These environmental stressors can impact mackerel growth rates, spawning success, and population distribution, directly influencing the biological characteristics and abundance of the fish stock.

## Detailed Analysis

### The Environment-Biology-Economic Causal Chain

The findings establish a clear, albeit complex, causal chain that connects the marine environment to fishery economics. This relationship can be modeled as follows:

**Marine Environment → Biological Response → Fishery Supply → Market Price Dynamics**

1.  **Environmental Drivers:** Long-term climatic cycles (ENSO, PDO) and short-term oceanographic changes (SST, chlorophyll-a concentration) create favorable or unfavorable conditions for chub mackerel. Warmer waters and reduced food availability during strong El Niño events can lead to slower growth, lower body condition, and reduced reproductive success.

2.  **Biological Response:** These environmental pressures manifest as observable changes in the fish population. The research confirms significant interannual variations in average weight, length, and condition factor. A year with favorable ocean conditions may produce a cohort of larger, healthier fish, while a poor year may result in smaller fish and lower overall biomass. The data from China showing an increasing trend in maximum size from 2016-2022 points to a period of potentially favorable conditions or changing fishery dynamics.

3.  **Fishery Supply:** The biological response directly dictates the fishery supply in two ways:
    *   **Quantity (Volume):** The total stock abundance determines the potential total allowable catch (TAC) and actual landings. The highly variable catch volumes in Mexico (from 230,000 to 1,180 tons) exemplify this volatility.
    *   **Quality (Size/Condition):** The average size and health (condition factor) of the landed fish determine the quality of the product available to the market.

4.  **Market Price Dynamics:** Basic economic principles suggest that supply influences price. A decrease in total landings (supply) would, ceteris paribus, lead to an increase in price. Critically, the "quality" factor introduces another layer of complexity. It is plausible that landings from a year with biologically larger and healthier fish would command a premium ex-vessel price per unit of weight, independent of the total catch volume. However, without correlated biological and price data, particularly from the major Chinese markets, this hypothesis cannot be empirically verified by this report.

### Key Economic Concepts

Understanding this market requires familiarity with core fisheries economic terms:
*   **Landings:** The portion of a fish catch that is brought to shore. This is distinct from "catch," which includes discards at sea [https://www.fao.org/4/a0231e/A0231E09.htm].
*   **Ex-vessel Price:** The price received by fishermen for their landings when sold to dealers or processors [January 2025 report on Gulf of America Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) pricing].
*   **Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE):** A measure of fish stock abundance, calculated as the quantity of fish caught for a given amount of fishing effort.
*   **Price Elasticity of Demand:** The percentage change in the quantity of fish demanded in response to a one percent change in its price. This metric is crucial for understanding how price changes will affect total revenue [https://studylib.net/doc/8039933/chapter-4-%E2%80%93-elasticity---mba-program-resources].

## Conclusion & Outlook

This research successfully establishes the foundational links between the marine environment, the biological state of chub mackerel stocks, and the economic dynamics of the fishery in key Pacific Rim nations. The most robust findings relate to the significant and measurable year-over-year variations in the size and weight of landed mackerel in China and Mexico. These biological fluctuations are the critical transmission mechanism through which large-scale environmental changes, like El Niño events, impact the economic outcomes of the fishing industry.

However, the analysis is constrained by a significant lack of comprehensive, publicly available time-series price data for chub mackerel in China's major aquatic markets. This data gap prevents a full quantitative modeling of the environment-to-market causal chain and an analysis of how fish quality (size) affects market prices.

**Management Implications:** The transboundary nature of the chub mackerel stock, coupled with its sensitivity to climate variations, poses a significant challenge for fisheries management. Management strategies based solely on historical catch data may be insufficient. A more resilient approach would integrate leading environmental indicators (e.g., SST forecasts, ENSO indices) to anticipate changes in stock abundance and condition, allowing for more dynamic quota setting and helping stakeholders prepare for periods of high or low supply.

**Future Outlook:** As climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like El Niño, the volatility in the chub mackerel fishery is likely to grow. This will create greater uncertainty for fishing fleets, processors, and markets. Future research should prioritize closing the economic data gap for Chinese markets and developing integrated econometric models (e.g., Vector Autoregression) to quantify the lag and magnitude of the relationships identified in this report. Such models could provide predictive insights, for example, forecasting how a shift in the PDO index might translate to a change in market prices 18-24 months later, offering a valuable tool for both policymakers and industry stakeholders.

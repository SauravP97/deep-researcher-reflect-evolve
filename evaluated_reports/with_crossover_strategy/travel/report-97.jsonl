An analysis of economic impact studies for three U.S. airports\u2014Rapid City Regional Airport (RAP), Kansas City Wheeler Downtown Airport (MKC), and Palm Springs International Airport (PSP)\u2014provides substantial evidence to support this hypothesis.\n\nThe data reveals that airports of this scale are powerful economic engines, contributing hundreds of millions of dollars in annual economic output and supporting several thousand jobs within their communities. These impacts are generated through a combination of direct on-airport activities (operations, tenants), indirect and induced effects within the supply chain, and wider catalytic impacts, most notably visitor spending that fuels local tourism economies.\n\nWhile the economic benefits are well-documented and quantifiable across all case studies, a critical finding of this review is the consistent absence of measurable data related to social impacts (e.g., regional connectivity, healthcare access, property values) and negative externalities (e.g., environmental impact, infrastructure strain). The reviewed reports focus exclusively on positive economic contributions, presenting a limitation in providing a fully holistic view of an airport's total regional impact.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### 1. Airports are Significant and Measurable Economic Engines\nThe economic impact studies for all three case airports demonstrate that their contributions are both significant in scale and measurable through established methodologies. The total annual economic output ranges from $456 million to over $625 million, supporting thousands of jobs and generating substantial labor income.\n\n*   **Rapid City Regional Airport (RAP):** Generates a total annual economic impact of **$456 million** for Pennington County, supporting **2,877 jobs** and generating **$119 million** in labor income [https://rapairport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RAP-Economic-Impact-Study-Final-2024.pdf].\n*   **Kansas City Wheeler Downtown Airport (MKC):** Creates a total economic output of **$625.2 million**, supports **2,796 jobs**, and generates a total payroll of **$251.3 million** for its region [https://mkc.airportstudy.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2024/03/MKC-AEIS-Technical-Report-FINAL-Feb-2024.pdf].\n*   **Palm Springs International Airport (PSP):** While a larger airport, its 2025 study illustrates the scale of impact, contributing **$2.5 billion** in total economic output, supporting **18,377 jobs**, and generating **$864 million** in wages [https://www.palmspringsca.gov/Home/Components/News/News/8357/551].\n\n### 2. Economic Impact is Driven by Multiple, Quantifiable Sources\nThe total economic impact is not monolithic; it is the sum of several distinct activities that can be individually measured. The primary drivers across the case studies are on-airport business tenants and off-airport visitor spending.\n\n*   **On-Airport Activity:** This includes direct airport administration, capital investments, and the operations of tenants such as airlines, concessionaires, and rental car agencies. For MKC, on-airport activities generate a direct output of $296.4 million and support 1,196 direct jobs [https://mkc.airportstudy.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2024/03/MKC-AEIS-Technical-Report-FINAL-Feb-2024.pdf]. At PSP, on-site businesses like rental cars and concessions produce gross sales exceeding $115 million [https://flypsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PSP-2025-Economic-Impact-Study.pdf].\n*   **Visitor Spending (Catalytic Impact):** A major portion of an airport's economic contribution comes from facilitating tourism. Spending by non-local visitors on accommodations, food, transportation, and retail is a primary driver of job creation. At RAP, commercial visitors account for $188 million in economic activity and 1,439 jobs, the largest single source of employment impact [https://rapairport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RAP-Economic-Impact-Study-Final-2024.pdf].\n\n### 3. Indirect and Induced Impacts Significantly Multiply the Economic Benefits\nThe initial direct spending and employment at an airport create a ripple effect throughout the regional economy. This multiplier effect, composed of indirect (supply chain) and induced (re-spending of wages) impacts, often doubles the initial economic footprint.\n\n*   The **MKC study** provides a clear example: 1,196 direct jobs from on-airport activities lead to an additional 1,260 indirect and induced jobs, demonstrating a multiplier effect greater than 2.0 on employment [https://mkc.airportstudy.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2024/03/MKC-AEIS-Technical-Report-FINAL-Feb-2024.pdf].\n*   The **PSP study** calculated an economic multiplier of approximately 1.68, meaning every dollar of direct output generated an additional $0.68 in indirect and induced output for the local economy [https://flypsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/PSP-Economic-Impact-Report.pdf].\n\n### 4. Critical Data Gaps Exist Regarding Social Impacts and Negative Externalities\nA systematic review of the economic impact reports for RAP, MKC, and PSP revealed a complete absence of quantified data on key social and environmental factors.\n\n*   **Social & Quality-of-Life Impacts:** None of the provided reports contained data or analysis on the airport's role in enhancing regional connectivity, improving access to healthcare, influencing local property values, or other quality-of-life metrics.\n*   **Negative Externalities:** Similarly, no data was available within the reports on negative impacts such as environmental effects (noise, emissions), land use conflicts, strain on public infrastructure, or the reliance on public subsidies. This indicates that standard airport economic impact studies may be designed to highlight positive contributions while omitting potential costs and drawbacks.\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\nThe following tables synthesize the specific data points extracted from the economic impact reports for Rapid City (RAP), Kansas City Downtown (MKC), and Palm Springs (PSP). They are organized according to the standard categories of economic impact analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Table 1: Direct Economic Impacts\n*Direct impacts result from on-airport economic activities.*\n\n| Airport | Employment Breakdown | Annual Payroll, Spending & Revenue | Local/Regional Tax Contributions |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Rapid City (RAP)** | **43** direct jobs (airport operations). **796** jobs from business tenants (airlines, concessions, etc.) [https://rapairport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RAP-Economic-Impact-Study-Final-2024.pdf]. | **$4.6M** output from airport operations. **$7.8M** from capital investments. **$196M** from business tenants [https://rapairport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RAP-Economic-Impact-Study-Final-2024.pdf]. | **$2.2M** in local tax revenue [https://rapairport.com/2023-economic-impact-study/]. |\n| **Kansas City (MKC)** | **1,196** total direct jobs: **29** (airport admin), **36** (capital expenditures), **1,131** (business tenants) [https://mkc.airportstudy.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2024/03/MKC-AEIS-Technical-Report-FINAL-Feb-2024.pdf]. | **$136.7M** direct payroll. **$296.4M** direct economic output [https://mkc.airportstudy.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2024/03/MKC-AEIS-Technical-Report-FINAL-Feb-2024.pdf]. | Data not available in provided reports. |\n| **Palm Springs (PSP)** | **135** TSA jobs. **53** jobs at Fixed-Base Operators (FBOs) [https://flypsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PSP-2025-Economic-Impact-Study.pdf]. | **$4.2M** average annual capital spending. **$464M** in airline passenger revenue. **$117.8M** in combined rental car & concession gross sales [https://flypsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PSP-2025-Economic-Impact-Study.pdf]. | **$382M** in total tax revenues generated for all levels of government [https://gaydesertguide.com/palm-springs-international-airport-fuels-2-5-billion-into-regional-economy-supports-over-18000-jobs/]. |\n\n---\n\n### Table 2: Indirect & Induced Economic Impacts\n*Indirect impacts are from supply chain spending;

The economic contributions, quantified in the hundreds of millions of dollars in output and the support of thousands of jobs, confirm that nonhub primary airports are vital components of regional economic infrastructure. The catalytic role these airports play in enabling tourism and business travel is a primary channel through which these substantial benefits are realized.\n\nHowever, the analysis also highlights a significant limitation in the scope of typical airport economic impact studies. The consistent and complete absence of data on social impacts and negative externalities suggests a narrow focus on quantifying positive economic benefits. This presents an incomplete picture for policymakers and community stakeholders.\n\nFor a more comprehensive understanding, future research and airport-commissioned studies should adopt a more holistic framework. Incorporating metrics related to quality-of-life, environmental costs, and infrastructure demands would provide a balanced assessment, enabling more informed decisions regarding airport development and regional planning. In summary, while the economic case is strong, the full socioeconomic story remains only partially told.\n\n## References\n\n*

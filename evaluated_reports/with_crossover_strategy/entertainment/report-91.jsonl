The universe's power is derived from \"Cosmo,\" an internal energy that, when mastered, allows for superhuman feats. This mastery is tiered through \"Senses,\" with the Seventh Sense granting movement at the speed of light and the Eighth Sense (Arayashiki) allowing a living being to enter the Underworld.\n\nThe primary focus of this analysis is on Athena's Saints, particularly the five main Bronze Saints: Pegasus Seiya, Dragon Shiryu, Cygnus Hyoga, Andromeda Shun, and Phoenix Ikki. The report tracks their significant power progression, the evolution of their Bronze Cloths into divine armors, their signature techniques, and their roles across the major story arcs (Sanctuary, Poseidon, Hades). Their journey exemplifies the core theme of the series: mortals transcending their limits to challenge and defeat divine beings.\n\nThe report also details the other major warrior factions, including Poseidon's Marina Generals and Hades' Specters, comparing their armors (Scales and Surplices) and power levels to those of Athena's Saints. While the research provides extensive detail on the main protagonists, data on secondary characters and antagonists is less comprehensive. The analysis concludes with a comparative power-scaling hierarchy and notes on the ongoing narrative in the sequel manga, *Saint Seiya: Next Dimension*.\n\n## Foundational Concepts: Cosmo and Armor Origins\n\nThe power system and cosmology of *Saint Seiya* are built upon two fundamental pillars: the mystical energy known as Cosmo and the protective armors worn by the warriors of different deities.\n\n### The Power of Cosmo\n\nCosmo is the foundational energy source in the series, described as the strength of the universe that resides within all living beings. Warriors known as Saints can consciously ignite this inner universe to perform superhuman feats, such as manipulating matter at an atomic level. The proficiency of a Saint is measured by their mastery over their Cosmo, which is often categorized by the awakening of metaphysical \"Senses.\"\n\n*   **Seventh Sense**: Considered the essence of a Gold Saint's power, the Seventh Sense represents a complete mastery and understanding of Cosmo. Awakening this sense allows a warrior to move and attack at the speed of light. The five main Bronze Saints achieve this level of power during their battles in the Sanctuary arc, enabling them to fight on par with the Gold Saints.\n*   **Eighth Sense (Arayashiki)**: A level of power that transcends the Seventh Sense. Its primary function is to allow a living being to enter the Underworld without being subject to its laws, which would otherwise result in their immediate death. Only a select few Saints are known to have achieved this state.\n\n### The Divine Armors\n\nThe armors in *Saint Seiya* are more than mere protection; they are living entities that grant their wearers immense power. The three primary types are Cloths, Scales, and Surplices.\n\n*   **Athena's Cloths**: Forged in the age of myth by the alchemists of Mu, there are 88 Cloths corresponding to the constellations. They are made from Orichalcum, Gammanium, and Stardust Sand. Cloths possess a life force of their own, are capable of minor self-repair, and are stored in \"Pandora Boxes\" in their constellation's totem form. A Cloth that has \"died\" can only be revived with a significant amount of a Saint's blood.\n*   **Poseidon's Scales**: Worn by the seven Marina Generals, these seven armors were forged from pure Orichalcum by Poseidon himself. Their defensive power and strength are considered equivalent to that of the Gold Cloths.\n*   **Hades' Surplices**: Worn by the 108 Specters, Surplices are forged from minerals unique to the Underworld. They are noted for their dark, menacing designs and are said to rival the Gold Cloths in durability. A key feature is their ability to allow Specters to travel freely between the living world and the Underworld.\n\n## Detailed Analysis of Warrior Classes\n\n### Athena's Saints: Bronze Saints\n\nThough they hold the lowest rank among Athena's 88 Saints, the five central protagonists consistently defy their classification, achieving power levels that rival and even surpass the elite Gold Saints.\n\n#### **Pegasus Seiya**\n\n*   **Power Level**: The series protagonist, Seiya's defining trait is his indomitable will and ability to endlessly push his Cosmo in critical moments. He is the first of his peers to awaken the Seventh Sense during his battle with Leo Aiolia. By the Hades arc, his power is comparable to that of a God Warrior.\n*   **Signature Techniques**:\n    *   **Pegasus Meteor Fist (Pegasasu Ry\u016bsei Ken)**: His primary attack, launching hundreds of punches per second at his opponent.\n    *   **Pegasus Comet Fist (Pegasasu Suisei Ken)**: Concentrates the power of the Meteor Fist into a single, devastating blow.\n    *   **Pegasus Rolling Crash**: A grappling maneuver where he seizes an opponent from behind and drives them into the ground from a great height.\n*   **Cloth Evolution**:\n    *   **V1**: Original Cloth worn during the Galaxian Wars.\n    *   **V2 (New Cloth)**: Repaired with the blood of the Gold Saints after the Sanctuary arc. Turns gold when Seiya elevates his Cosmo to its peak.\n    *   **V3 (Final Cloth)**: Repaired with Athena's blood before entering the Underworld.\n    *   **Divine Cloth**: Awakened in the final battle in Elysion through Athena's blood and his peak Cosmo.\n*   **Key Arcs & Fate**: Seiya is central to every major conflict. He overcomes numerous Gold Saints, battles Poseidon, and ultimately confronts Hades. At the end of the classic manga, he is struck by Hades' cursed sword and left in a catatonic state, expected to die. His fate is the central plot of the sequel *Saint Seiya: Next Dimension*, where Athena and his friends travel to the past to find a way to save his life. His ultimate outcome remains unresolved as the manga is still ongoing.\n\n#### **Dragon Shiryu**\n\n*   **Power Level**: Known for his incredible defensive capabilities and willingness to make extreme sacrifices, such as blinding himself to defeat Perseus Algol. He awakens his Seventh Sense against Cancer Deathmask and later inherits the legendary technique \"Excalibur\" from Capricorn Shura.\n*   **Signature Techniques**:\n    *   **Rozan Sh\u014d Ry\u016b Ha (Rising Dragon Force)**: A powerful uppercut that carries the risk of leaving his heart exposed for a fraction of a second.\n    *   **Rozan Hyakury\u016b Ha (One Hundred Dragons Force)**: An ultimate attack that unleashes the force of one hundred dragons, far surpassing the Sh\u014d Ry\u016b Ha.\n    *   **Excalibur**: A powerful, invisible sword strike concentrated in his right arm, a gift from the dying Capricorn Shura.\n*   **Cloth Evolution**: The Dragon Cloth is famed for its near-impenetrable shield.\n    *   **V1**: Damaged during the Sanctuary arc. Required half of Shiryu's blood for Mu of Aries to repair.\n    *   **V2 & V3**: Evolutions follow the same pattern as Seiya's, repaired with Gold Saint and then Athena's blood.\n    *   **Divine Cloth**: Awakened in Elysion.\n*   **Key Arcs & Fate**: Shiryu's pivotal moments include defeating Deathmask, surviving Shura's final attack, and using the inherited Excalibur to shatter Chrysaor Krishna's Golden Lance in the Poseidon arc. He survives the Hades war and, in *Next Dimension*, travels to the past to save Seiya, where he encounters his future master, Libra D\u014dko, as a young man.\n\n#### **Cygnus Hyoga**\n\n*   **Power Level**: A master of ice-based techniques, Hyoga's power culminates in his ability to reach Absolute Zero (\u2212273.15 \u00b0C), a temperature that can freeze anything, including a Gold Cloth. He achieves this during his life-or-death struggle against his master, Aquarius Camus.\n*   **Signature Techniques**:\n    *   **Diamond Dust**: His fundamental technique, a blast of super-chilled air and ice crystals.\n    *   **Kol'tso (Frozen Ring)**: Creates ice rings to immobilize an opponent.\n    *   **Aurora Thunder Attack**: A more powerful vortex of freezing energy.\n    *   **Aurora Execution**: His ultimate technique, inherited from Camus, which projects a blast of Cosmo at Absolute Zero.\n*   **Cloth Evolution**:\n    *   **V1/V2/V3**: Follows the standard progression of repairs and power-ups via divine blood.\n    *   **Divine Cloth**: Achieved during the final battle in Elysion.\n*   **Key Arcs & Fate**: Hyoga's journey is defined by emotional conflicts: facing his master Camus in the Sanctuary and his childhood friend, Kraken Isaac, in the Poseidon arc. He survives the Hades war, even wearing the Aquarius Gold Cloth against Thanatos. In *Next Dimension*, he joins the quest to the past to save Seiya.\n\n#### **Andromeda Shun**\n\n*   **Power Level**: Despite his gentle and pacifist nature, Shun possesses an immense Cosmo. His primary weapon is the Andromeda Chain, which has incredible offensive and defensive capabilities. He is revealed to be the chosen human vessel for Hades' soul.\n*   **Signature Techniques**:\n    *   **Nebula Chain**: Uses his chains to track, attack, and defend automatically.\n    *   **Nebula Stream/Storm**: When stripped of his chains and Cloth, Shun can manifest his Cosmo as a defensive stream of air (Nebula Stream) that evolves into an incredibly destructive offensive vortex (Nebula Storm).\n*   **Cloth Evolution**: The Andromeda Cloth is unique due to its integrated chains.\n    *   **V1**: Original Cloth.\n    *   **V2 (New Cloth)**: Repaired with the blood of Taurus Aldebaran. Visual changes are minor.\n    *   **V3 (Final Cloth)**: Repaired with Athena's blood. The design is noted for being nearly as complex as a Divine Cloth.\n    *   **Divine Cloth**: Awakened in Elysion.\n*   **Key Arcs & Fate**: Shun awakens his Eighth Sense to enter the Underworld. His most significant arc is being possessed by Hades, forcing his brother Ikki and Athena to fight to expel the god's spirit. He regains control and continues fighting. In *Next Dimension*, he is a central figure in the journey to the past to save Seiya, with his power being comparable to that of a Gold Saint.\n\n#### **Phoenix Ikki**\n\n*   **Power Level**: The most powerful of the Bronze Saints, Ikki is a lone wolf defined by his aggressive Cosmo and incredible resilience. His Phoenix Cloth can regenerate from ashes, allowing him to return from death stronger than before. He awakens his Seventh Sense against Virgo Shaka.\n*   **Signature Techniques**:\n    *   **H\u014d\u014d Genma Ken (Phoenix Illusion Demon Fist)**: A mental attack that shatters an opponent's mind by showing them terrifying illusions, leaving their body an empty shell.\n    *   **H\u014dyoku Tensh\u014d (Phoenix's Wings Rise)**: A devastating fiery blast of Cosmo that takes the form of a phoenix, capable of annihilating multiple opponents at once and even damaging their spirit. Its power is said to be comparable to the Gemini Saints' Galaxian Explosion.\n*   **Cloth Evolution**: The Phoenix Cloth is unique, as it can self-repair without the need for a Saint's blood.\n    *   **V1**: Used until his battle with Virgo Shaka.\n    *   **V2**: Revived by Ikki himself (manga) or Shaka's blood (anime).\n    *   **V3**: Regenerated from its own power during the Hades arc.\n    *   **Divine Cloth**: Awakened in Elysion with the help of Athena's blood.\n*   **Key Arcs & Fate**: Ikki's key battles include his self-sacrificing victory over Shaka, surviving Gemini Saga's Galaxian Explosion, and defeating Garuda Aiacos, one of the three Underworld Judges. He survives the Hades arc and plays a central role in *Next Dimension*, traveling to the past to aid his friends.\n\n---\n\n### Athena's Saints: Secondary Bronze Saints\n\nA group of Bronze Saints who initially serve as rivals in the Galaxian Wars and later become loyal allies.\n\n*   **Members**: Unicorn Jabu, Hydra Ichi, Lionet Ban, Bear Geki, and Wolf Nachi.\n*   **Role & Abilities**: Their roles are limited compared to the main five. They possess superhuman abilities and signature techniques but do not achieve the same cosmic heights.\n    *   **Unicorn Jabu**: Uses **Unicorn Gallop**.\n    *   **Hydra Ichi**: Uses **Mellow Poison**, poisonous fangs that extend from his Cloth.\n    *   **Lionet Ban**: Uses **Lionet Bomber**.\n    *   **Bear Geki**: Uses **Hanging Bear**, a powerful bear hug.\n    *   **Wolf Nachi**: Uses **Dead Howling**.\n*   **Outcome**: They primarily serve in a support capacity, notably guarding the Sanctuary. They collectively defeat a group of guards at the Sanctuary entrance by combining their techniques.\n\n### Other Warrior Classes\n\nThe provided research contains limited, specific information on other warrior classes, primarily focusing on them in the context of their battles with the Bronze Saints.\n\n*   **Athena's Gold Saints**: The twelve most powerful Saints, each a master of the Seventh Sense. Key figures encountered by the protagonists include **Leo Aiolia**, **Cancer Deathmask**, **Capricorn Shura**, **Aquarius Camus**, and **Virgo Shaka**, all of whom were instrumental, willingly or not, in the Bronze Saints' growth. A comprehensive analysis of all twelve was not available in the provided data.\n*   **Poseidon's Marina Generals**: The seven elite warriors serving Poseidon. Their Scales are equal in power to Gold Cloths. The research highlighted two: **Chrysaor Krishna**, who was defeated by Shiryu's Excalibur, and **Kraken Isaac**, Hyoga's former friend whom he was forced to defeat.\n*   **Hades' Specters**: The 108 warriors of the Underworld. Their Surplices are on par with Gold Cloths. The most powerful are the Three Judges. The research specifically mentions **Garuda Aiacos**, who was defeated by Phoenix Ikki.\n*   **Asgard's God Warriors**: A faction exclusive to the anime's Asgard arc. No detailed information on their members, God Robes, or techniques was available in the provided research logs.\n\n## Comparative Framework & Conclusion\n\n### Power-Scaling Hierarchy\n\nBased on the synthesis of the provided data, a general power hierarchy can be established:\n\n1.  **Olympian Gods (Hades, Poseidon, Athena)**: Beings of immense, reality-altering power.\n2.  **Divine Cloth Saints**: The five protagonists in their ultimate armors, capable of injuring gods.\n3.  **Gold Saints / Marina Generals / Specter Judges**: Masters of the Seventh Sense, operating at the speed of light. Their power levels are roughly equivalent.\n4.  **Bronze Saints (Post-Sanctuary)**: After awakening the Seventh Sense, their power becomes comparable to the Gold Saint tier.\n5.  **Silver Saints**: Mid-tier warriors superior to standard Bronze Saints.\n6.  **Secondary & Early Bronze Saints**: The baseline for Athena's warriors.\n\n### Conclusion and Outlook\n\nThe *Saint Seiya* franchise is fundamentally a story of human potential and perseverance. The narrative consistently demonstrates that rank and armor classification are secondary to the power of a warrior's Cosmo, which can be infinitely expanded through willpower and sacrifice. The five main Bronze Saints embody this theme, beginning as the lowest-ranked warriors and evolving to a level where they can confront and defeat gods.\n\nTheir journey is marked by the constant evolution of their Cloths, which serve as a physical manifestation of their growing power. From repairs with the blood of Gold Saints to the final blessing of Athena's own divine blood, these armors chart a path from mortal equipment to divine armament.\n\nThe classic story concludes with the defeat of Hades, but the narrative remains open. The ongoing sequel, *Saint Seiya: Next Dimension*, continues the saga, focusing on the mission to save Pegasus Seiya from Hades' curse. This time-traveling plot revisits the previous Holy War, further exploring the lore and the relationships between the characters across generations. The ultimate fate of Seiya and his fellow Saints has yet to be written, leaving the future of the franchise open to further exploration of its core themes.\n\n### References\n\nThe information in this

The core finding is that all three are deeply committed value investors who view buying a stock as buying a piece of a business. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are the architects of a modern value investing framework that evolved from Benjamin Graham's quantitative \"cigar-butt\" approach to a qualitative focus on buying \"wonderful companies at a fair price.\" Munger's unique contribution was the integration of a multidisciplinary \"latticework of mental models,\" with a heavy emphasis on understanding psychological biases to avoid common errors.\n\nDuan Yongping, often called the \"Chinese Buffett,\" is a devoted and highly successful practitioner of the Buffett-Munger philosophy. Having studied their principles extensively, he has adapted them with an entrepreneur's perspective, applying them successfully to the technology sector and the Chinese market. His philosophy is distinguished by the core concept of \"Benfen\" (doing the right thing) and a strategy of extreme portfolio concentration in high-conviction ideas. While their methods have faced criticism regarding scale and relevance in modern markets, the foundational principles of understanding businesses, demanding a margin of safety, and maintaining a long-term, disciplined mindset remain profoundly influential.\n\n---\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### 1. Foundational Profiles of the Investors\n\n*   **Warren E. Buffett:** Born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1930, Buffett began his investment career by establishing Buffett Partnership Ltd. in 1956. He later took control of the textile mill Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, transforming it into his primary investment vehicle [https://www.lifestories.org/interviewees/warren-buffett, https://www.britannica.com/money/Warren-Edward-Buffett]. His annual shareholder letters are considered essential reading for investors [https://archive.org/details/berkshirehathawayletters].\n\n*   **Charles \"Charlie\" T. Munger:** Born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1924, Munger worked at Warren Buffett's grandfather's grocery store in his youth. Trained as a lawyer at Harvard, he later ran his own successful investment partnership, Wheeler, Munger, from 1962 to 1975 before formally joining Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway. His speeches and writings, particularly from Wesco Financial and Daily Journal meetings, are widely studied for their multidisciplinary wisdom [PDF compilation, \"The Best Of Charlie Munger: 1994-2011\"].\n\n*   **Duan Yongping:** Born in Nanchang, China, in 1961, Duan is an electrical engineer and highly successful entrepreneur. He founded BBK Electronics Group, the parent company of smartphone giants Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus, and Realme, earning him the title \"godfather\" of China's smartphone industry. After semi-retiring, he became a prominent investor, adapting the Buffett-Munger philosophy. His interviews and blog posts are his primary source materials [https://tianpan.co/blog/2025-02-15-duan-yongping-three-core-business-ideas].\n\n### 2. The Buffett-Munger Framework: An Evolution in Value Investing\n\nThe partnership between Buffett and Munger is central to the evolution of modern value investing. Their shared philosophy is built on the principle of viewing a stock purchase as acquiring a piece of an actual business [https://www.investopedia.com/buffett-and-munger-identify-winning-stocks-11873636].\n\n**From \"Cigar-Butts\" to \"Wonderful Companies\"**\nInitially, Buffett followed his mentor Benjamin Graham\u2019s \"cigar-butt\" strategy: buying struggling companies at prices so low they offered one last profitable \"puff\" [https://acquirersmultiple.com/2024/08/warren-buffett-why-i-transitioned-from-cigar-butts-to-quality-companies/]. Charlie Munger was instrumental in shifting this focus, convincing Buffett that \"it\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a mediocre one at a bargain\" [https://acquirersmultiple.com/2024/08/warren-buffett-why-i-transitioned-from-cigar-butts-to-quality-companies/]. Both later acknowledged the \"cigar-butt\" method was a \"mistake\" and not scalable [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-just-turned-93-160145468.html].\n\n**Core Tenets of Warren Buffett**\nBuffett's approach centers on four key principles for selecting a business:\n*   **Circle of Competence:** Only invest in businesses you can fundamentally understand [https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/trading-lessons/circle-of-competence/].\n*   **Economic Moat:** The business must possess a durable competitive advantage (e.g., strong brand, low-cost production) that protects long-term profitability [https://www.facebook.com/Investopedia/posts/learn-how-warren-buffetts-circle-of-competence-rule-for-evaluating-investments-c/1201210042030802/].\n*   **Management Quality:** The business must be run by able and trustworthy leaders. Buffett judges management on two \"yardsticks\": how they allocate capital and how they treat shareholders versus themselves [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/08/warren-buffett-heres-how-to-judge-management.html].\n*   **Margin of Safety:** Purchase the business at a significant discount to its intrinsic value to provide a cushion against errors and market volatility [https://www.facebook.com/Investopedia/posts/learn-how-warren-buffetts-circle-of-competence-rule-for-evaluating-investments-c/1201210042030802/].\n\n**Core Tenets of Charlie Munger**\nMunger expanded this framework with a focus on multidisciplinary thinking and avoiding cognitive errors:\n*   **Latticework of Mental Models:** Munger advocated for drawing knowledge from a wide range of disciplines (psychology, physics, biology) to analyze problems from multiple angles. He believed 80-90 core models were sufficient to handle most situations [https://www.raymondjames.com/rzrwealthmanagement/rzr-notes/2024/12/12/not-so-poor-charlie].\n*   **Inversion:** A key mental model is to \"Invert, always invert.\" Instead of asking how to succeed, one should ask what would guarantee failure and then assiduously avoid those factors [https://drinknumin.com/blogs/news/charlie-mungers-mental-models-framework?srsltid=AfmBOoqRVhc8yrUIsZSYoaqNYCGuaLR9svb_SFoAf9Rwx6en9IgmiwYZ].\n*   **The Psychology of Human Misjudgment:** Munger compiled a list of 25 common cognitive biases that lead to irrational decisions. His philosophy emphasizes emotional discipline and the importance of recognizing and counteracting these tendencies, such as doubt-avoidance and biased group dynamics [Source: Summary of \"The Psychology of Human Misjudgment\"].\n\n### 3. Duan Yongping: The Entrepreneurial Disciple\n\nDuan Yongping is a direct intellectual descendant of Buffett and Munger, having learned their philosophy from public writings like \"Poor Charlie's Almanack\" [https://en.zhihu.com/article/713188083]. He states that his value investing approach is \"completely the same\" as Buffett's in principle [https://news.futunn.com/en/post/58710159/weekend-reading-duan-yongping-s-three-major-investment-principles-do].\n\n**Core Philosophy and \"Benfen\"**\nDuan\u2019s approach is centered on investing in companies with simple, understandable business models and thinking like a company founder [https://www.the-momentum.net/p/duan-yongping-value-investing-through]. The core of his philosophy is the concept of **\"Benfen,\"** which translates to \"Do the right thing, and do things right\" [https://gotochina.guide/bbk-electronics-duan-yongping-the-unseen-empire-behind-oppo-vivo-and-jt-express/]. This principle prioritizes long-term value, integrity, and accountability over short-term profits. A key practice for Duan is creating a \"not-to-do list\" to avoid investing in what he doesn't understand or in companies with integrity issues [https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605067301].\n\n**Portfolio Strategy: Extreme Concentration**\nA defining feature of Duan's strategy is his preference for **extreme portfolio concentration**. He believes risk is managed through the quality of the companies selected, not by spreading capital widely. He is comfortable holding as few as 8-12 stocks. As of Q2 2025, his $11.53 billion portfolio was spread across just 10 stocks, with his top investment, Apple, representing 60% of the total value [https://www.gainify.io/blog/duan-yongping-portfolio, https://www.tikr.com/blog/duan-yongpings-stock-portfolio-the-billionaires-top-5-recent-buys].\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### Comparative Analysis of Core Principles\n\n| Principle | Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger | Duan Yongping |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Definition of a 'Good Business'** | An understandable business with a durable economic moat, strong brand, loyal customers, and run by able and trustworthy management [https://www.financialexpress.com/market/warren-buffett-vs-charlie-munger-key-differences-similarities-between-two-investing-giants-3119693/]. | Nearly identical: Companies with excellent business models, strong integrity, and a culture that can be sustained long-term. Emphasizes thinking like a founder, focusing on product competitiveness and user sentiment [https://www.the-momentum.net/p/duan-yongping-value-investing-through]. |\n| **Valuation Framework** | Value is the discounted value of future cash flows (\"owner earnings\"). Buffett uses DCF analysis not for a precise figure, but to evaluate a company's risk and resilience [https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/category/investing-guru/buffett/page/4/]. | Explicitly states that value is \"discounted future cash flow.\" A true \"margin of safety\" comes from understanding a company better than the market does [https://news.futunn.com/en/post/58710159/weekend-reading-duan-yongping-s-three-major-investment-principles-do, https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605067301]. |\n| **Portfolio Concentration** | They advocate for concentration, believing diversification is protection against ignorance. However, Berkshire's portfolio is large and contains dozens of positions due to its scale. | Practices \"extreme concentration,\" often holding as few as 8-12 stocks. Believes deep knowledge of a few great companies is superior to broad diversification [https://www.gainify.io/blog/duan-yongping-portfolio]. |\n| **Market Efficiency & Risk** | Their entire philosophy is predicated on the belief that markets are not always efficient, which creates opportunities to buy great businesses at attractive prices. Risk is defined as the permanent loss of capital, not market volatility. | Aligns with the Buffett-Munger view. He ignores short-term market fluctuations, viewing them as either noise or an opportunity, provided one's understanding of the business is superior to the market's [https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605067301]. |\n| **Macroeconomic Forecasting** | Information on their specific views regarding macroeconomic forecasting was not available in the provided research logs. | Information on his specific views regarding macroeconomic forecasting was not available in the provided research logs. |\n\n### Philosophies in Practice: Iconic Investment Case Studies\n\n*   **See's Candies (Buffett/Munger):** This acquisition exemplified the shift to quality. See's possessed a powerful brand and customer loyalty, giving it significant pricing power (an economic moat) that allowed it to generate high returns without requiring substantial capital reinvestment.\n*   **Coca-Cola (Buffett/Munger, 1988):** Buffett invested $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola, seeing a global brand with a dominant moat and consistently growing free cash flows. The investment grew more than tenfold in a decade, validating the \"wonderful company\" thesis.\n*   **Apple (Buffett/Munger & Duan):**\n    *   **Buffett** views Apple not as a tech company but as a consumer products company \"beloved by its customers\" with a powerful ecosystem (moat) and one of the \"best managers in the world\" in Tim Cook [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/03/apple-is-buffetts-biggest-stock-but-moat-thesis-faces-questions.html].\n    *   **Munger** saw Apple as a \"logical candidate\" for investment because it was a quality business trading cheaply, arguing that investors needed to own such dominant tech companies [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/charlie-munger-big-tech-magnificent-stocks-buffett-berkshire-investing-apple-2023-11].\n    *   **Duan** made Apple his largest holding, basing his conviction on projections of the company's future profits and its strong business model [Source: Duan Yongping investment thesis for Apple Inc.].\n*   **Kweichow Moutai (Duan):** This is Duan's main holding in mainland China. It demonstrates his long-term buy-and-hold strategy (over 12 years), his preference for simple and predictable businesses with strong brands, and his contrarian stance against market anxiety.\n*   **Pinduoduo (Duan):** An interesting case, Duan became a major early investor. His use of selling put options suggests a belief that the stock had \"bottomed out.\" Paradoxically, he claimed he \"doesn't understand Pinduoduo,\" which may reflect a humble admission of not knowing every detail while having strong conviction in its core model or leadership.\n\n### Evolution, Mistakes, and Intellectual Lineage\n\n*   **Buffett's Dexter Shoe Mistake:** Buffett calls the 1993 acquisition of Dexter Shoe his \"most gruesome mistake.\" He failed to see that its competitive advantage was not sustainable against foreign competition. The error was compounded by using undervalued Berkshire stock for the purchase, turning a $433 million loss into a multi-billion-dollar opportunity cost and a powerful lesson.\n*   **Li Lu's Influence on Munger:** Investor Li Lu convinced a skeptical Munger to invest in the Chinese automaker BYD. Munger later referred to it as \"the investment he tried to stop.\" This demonstrates Munger's willingness to overcome his initial bias when presented with a powerful, well-reasoned argument, a core tenet of his philosophy [https://quartr.com/insights/investment-strategy/li-lu-the-man-who-impressed-charlie-munger, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbgqkAQ41mM].\n*   **Duan's Philosophy on Mistakes:** Duan's approach is centered on \"making fewer mistakes.\" He follows a rule to sell and move on if he becomes dissatisfied with a company, avoiding the trap of \"doubling down on a wrong path\" [Source: Duan Yongping public reflections on failed investments or mistakes]. Information on specific failed investments by Duan was not available in the provided research.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion & Outlook\n\nThe investment philosophies of Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Duan Yongping represent a coherent and powerful intellectual lineage. Buffett and Munger established a durable framework for long-term, quality-focused value investing, with Munger adding critical layers of multidisciplinary thinking and behavioral psychology. Duan Yongping serves as the framework's most prominent modern practitioner, demonstrating its successful application in different geographic (China) and economic (technology) contexts, all while adding his own entrepreneurial insights and a disciplined focus on portfolio concentration.\n\n**Criticisms and Modern Relevance**\nCritics argue that the massive scale of Berkshire Hathaway makes it difficult to find investments large enough to impact returns and that their value-oriented style is less effective in today's fast-moving, technology-driven markets [Source: criticisms of Buffett-Munger investment style].\n\nHowever, the core principles of their philosophies remain highly relevant. The emphasis on business fundamentals provides a durable anchor in volatile markets. As technology companies mature, many exhibit the very traits these investors seek: consistent earnings, strong economic moats, and efficient capital management [https://www.levelheadedinvesting.com/p/tech-driven-value-how-technology-companies-fit-in-today-investment-strategy]. Ultimately, the disciplined, rational, and business-focused approach championed by Buffett, Munger, and Duan offers a timeless alternative to short-term speculation, providing a robust framework for navigating the complexities of any market environment.\n\n---\n\n## References/Sources\n\n*

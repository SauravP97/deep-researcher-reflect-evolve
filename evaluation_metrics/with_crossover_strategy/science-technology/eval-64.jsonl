{"id": 64, "prompt": "Regarding the attitude control problem for UAVs, most open-source flight controllers currently implement cascaded PID control algorithms. However, a single set of PID controller parameters typically performs well only under specific flight conditions. In practical applications, UAVs operate across diverse flight states. What methods can be employed to enhance the actual control performance of PID algorithms, and how should PID parameters be optimally selected?", "comprehensiveness": 0.4494720965309201, "insight": 0.44801223241590205, "instruction_following": 0.482444733420026, "readability": 0.46771879483500717, "overall_score": 0.4583747587578221}

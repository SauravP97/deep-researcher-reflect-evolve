{"id": 58, "prompt": "Exploring Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) in Plants and animals (ie Non-Microbial Systems)\nYou could examine instances of horizontal gene transfer in eukaryotes—particularly plants and animals—and evaluate the evolutionary significance of these transfers. Its very rare and therefore must have a really interesting reason behind this adaptation!\nEspecially as this horizontal gene transfer has been well -studied in microbial systems, but not in plants and animals (this is a relatively new discovery).  Understanding  how commonly genes move between eukaryotic species and whether these transfers confer benefits would be really interesting to find out", "comprehensiveness": 0.4234234234234234, "insight": 0.41590214067278286, "instruction_following": 0.4626865671641791, "readability": 0.47520661157024796, "overall_score": 0.43467539520615295}

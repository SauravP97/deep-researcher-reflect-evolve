{"id": 54, "prompt": "In the field of FinTech, machine learning algorithms are now widely applied to asset allocation and investment decisions. Examples include classic models like Mean-Variance and Black-Litterman, as well as emerging deep learning models. While these models have shown certain advantages under different market conditions, each also has its limitations. For instance, the Mean-Variance model assumes asset returns follow a normal distribution, which often doesn't align with actual market conditions. The Black-Litterman model relies on subjective view inputs, introducing a degree of subjectivity. Although deep learning models can handle complex non-linear relationships, they suffer from poor interpretability.
